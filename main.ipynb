After attending boarding school in Paris, Pissarro returned to the West Indies to work for his father from 1847 until 1852. As an artist he was largely self-taught, receiving some instruction from Fritz Melbye (1826-1896), a Danish artist with whom he traveled to Venezuela in 1852. When Pissarro returned to Paris in 1855, he shared a studio with Anton Melbye (1818-1875), Fritz\\'s brother, and with David Jacobsen (1821-1871). He took classes at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1856 and three years later attended the Académie Suisse, where he befriended artists such as Cézanne (q.v.), Monet (q.v.), and Guillaumin (q.v.). Corot (q.v.) encouraged him to paint landscapes around Paris, and he was listed as Corot\\'s pupil in the catalogues of the Salons of 1864 and 1865. He had met Julie Vellay in 1860, with whom he would have eight children; they married in 1871. Pissarro exhibited regularly at the Salons from 1859 to 1870, although his work received little attention and he sold hardly anything. In 1866 he settled in Pontoise, often returning to Paris where he kept a studio. He frequented Émile Zola\\'s \"Thursdays\" (weekly literary gatherings) and associated with Manet\\'s (q.v.) artistic circle that gathered in the Café Guerbois. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) Pissarro fled with his family, first to Montfoucault and then to London, where he worked with Monet and Daubigny (q.v.) and was introduced to the dealer Durand-Ruel. In 1872 he returned to Pontoise, where he painted with Cézanne. Around 1869 Pissarro began painting in a purely impressionist style, and in 1874 he helped organize the first impressionist exhibition. He moved to Éragny-sur-Epte in 1884, where he came into contact with Seurat (q.v.) and Paul Signac (1863-1935) and subsequently began to work in a pointillist style. He eventually found this technique too limiting, and returned to an impressionist mode, often working in series. By the end of his career his landscapes and depictions of city life sold well, and in 1892 he was given a retrospective exhibition at Durand-Ruel. By now, the artist had developed strongly anarchist convictions. Pissarro not only painted and made drawings, he also experimented with etching and lithography.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1830', 'death_year': '1903'}]\n",

Constantin (1756-1844) at the free drawing academy in Aix. A fellow pupil was the highborn Auguste de Forbin (1777-1841), who became his most important friend and patron. In 1793 Granet participated in the siege of Toulon, where he met Bonaparte and worked as a draftsman with the artillery battery. Three years later he made his first visit to Paris, where he admired and copied Dutch and Flemish paintings in the Louvre. In 1798 Granet returned to Paris to join Forbin in the atelier of David (q.v.), but he had to leave after a few months from lack of funds. The next year, however, he showed at the Salon; his successful Little Cloister of the Feuillants (untraced), a Parisian monastery interior, announced the dominant theme of his subsequent work, which owed more to his study of seventeenth-century northern masters than it did to the brief stay in David\\'s studio. In 1802 Granet and Forbin went to Rome, where Granet remained generally for the next twenty-two years, making a living during the first years by selling views of ancient monuments. His internationally acclaimed Choir of the Capuchin Church in Rome (possibly the work dated 1815 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), of which the Cleveland painting is a late variant, sealed the artist\\'s success. In 1819 Granet was named knight of the Legion of Honor and in 1822 knight of the Order of St. Michael. His precisely painted pictures appealed through their dramatic chiaroscuro and masterful articulation of architectural forms. In the Italian and French countryside Granet also created many fluid oil and watercolor landscape sketches, whose simplified forms and subtle light effects prefigured the art of Corot (q.v.). By the end of the 1830s the vogue for Granet\\'s quietly religious paintings waned. In the meantime he had begun an important career as a museum official. Having left Rome in 1824 to accept a position offered by Forbin, Granet became chief curator at the Louvre in 1826 and then curator of Louis-Philippe\\'s new Musée Historique de Versailles in 1833. He was also named, in 1844, honorary director of the museum in his hometown of Aix. His long-time friend Forbin died in 1841, and in 1843 Granet married the recently widowed Marie-Madeleine Appoloni (\"Nena\"), whom he had known since the early days in Rome. Upon her death in 1847 Granet went to his country residence in Aix, where he remained after the revolution of 1848. The next year\\'s bequeathal of studio and collection to the Aix museum constitutes a rare example of the preservation of an artists\\'s atelier at the time.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1775', 'death_year': '1849'}]\n",

However, he first worked as a sales agent until 1848, when he entered the studio of landscape painter Jean-Alexis Achard (1807-1884). Harpignies traveled to Crémieu and Brussels with Achard but decided to return home upon the outbreak of the revolution of 1848. After the revolution, he traveled through southern Germany and to Italy, where the natural surroundings made a strong impact on his work and where he first became interested in watercolor. He was accepted into the Salon of 1853 and exhibited there regularly until 1912. Harpignies was influenced by Corot (q.v.) and the other Barbizon painters and worked in their manner. He traveled throughout France, visiting the forest of Fontainebleau, the Pyrenees, Nevers, and other areas, making landscape studies.

He soon befriended romantic painter Théodore Géricault (1791-1824) and exhibited at his first Salon in 1822 his powerful, moody The Barque of Dante (Musée du Louvre, Paris). In the next Salon, inspired by the recent events in the Greeks\\' struggle for independence against the Turks, Delacroix showed Scenes from the Massacres at Chios (Musée du Louvre, Paris), a painting whose anti-academic composition, free brushwork, and brilliant color caused hostile critics to accuse the artist of the \"massacre of painting.\" Nevertheless, he was awarded a Salon medal and the state purchased the picture. \\r\\nAfter the early death of Géricault, the young artist became the titular head of the French romantic artistic movement, as much for his innovative technique as his new themes. Widely read and an Anglophile, Delacroix drew frequently from British literature, especially Shakespeare, Byron, and Sir Walter Scott. He also developed a strong interest in orientalist subjects, spurred by the five-month trip to Morocco and southern Spain he took in 1832. He stressed the creative and imaginative elements of painting and opposed the academy for its rote learning and the bourgeoisie for its overly materialistic interests. Delacroix discussed his aesthetic ideas with an ever-expanding circle of writers, musicians, and artists that he frequented, including pianist-composer Frédéric Chopin and writer George Sand. But ultimately he developed a personal conception of beauty that could only be expressed in an individualized manner. \\r\\nRecent studies have revised the long-standing interpretation of Delacroix as a radical, anticlassical, misunderstood, and unsupported genius. He greatly admired antiquity and the classical authors but insisted on avoiding the narrow or didactic view of them offered by the academies. He may not have emulated classical statuary as sources for his figures, but he did often represent heroic nude figures. For all his insistence on invention, Delacroix retained some sense of documentary reconstruction, for he made numerous studies of costumes and weapons and did other kinds of research before tackling certain subjects. From the beginning and throughout his career, Delacroix received many religious and historical painting commissions, from provincial churches to government buildings, under different rulers and even political systems. His allegorical work Liberty Leading the Barricades (1830-31, Musée du Louvre, Paris) represents the only painting in which the artist referred to a contemporary political event in France, the revolution that overthrew Louis XVIII and the Bourbon monarchy. This, too, was purchased by the state. In 1833 he was asked to decorate with allegories the Salon du Roi of the Palais Bourbon, the seat of the deputies. Their success brought him additional commissions in the same building, such as the library (1838), and then the library in the senate (1841-46), housed in the Palais du Luxembourg. His historical, religious, and allegorical paintings were often criticized by more conservative critics for a lack of decorum, anatomical distortions, too-bright or unnaturalistic color, and free brushwork, but he continued to find work because he was one of the few artists who continued to explore these \"elevated\" genres and had a sure sense of the decorative. \\r\\nExtremely prolific, Delacroix accomplished a major mural commission for the church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris (1850-63) the year before his death. He was even elected in 1857 to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, but younger artists consistently regarded him as antiestablishment and a paragon of artistic experimentation. He wrote extensively on art and aesthetic issues, both in his private diaries and for published journals.1\\r\\n1. Recently, scholars such as Michele Hannoosh, Painting and the Journal of Eugene Delacroix (Princeton, 1995), have examined the content and style of Delacroix\\'s texts for what they might tell about Delacroix the writer as well as the work and creative process of Delacroix the artist.\\r\\nDelacroix was one of the most innovative and successful painters of the first half of the 19th century. He is known as the last great history painter and his art is the ideal of Romanticism in the visual arts. Delacroix\\'s career is marked by the paradox between the revolutionary and the conventional. He was in conflict with the artist Ingres and was seen as the leading figure of the French Romantic movement; he was famed for undermining the tradition of painting established by David, yet he benefited from official patronage from the beginning of the Restoration (1814-1830) until the Second Empire (1852-1870).', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1798', 'death_year': '1863'}]\n",

After his failure in the Prix de Rome competitions for landscape, newly instituted in 1817, Delaroche switched in 1818 to the studio of history painter Gros (q.v.). \\r\\nDelaroche's first participation in the Salon in 1819 won him praise for his paintings of subjects from the Old and New Testaments. At this time the Bourbon monarchy, reinstalled since 1815, promoted religious painting as the most moral and principled subjects, in large part their reaction to the mythological painting produced during Napoleon's reign, which needed new kinds of art and iconography to express the authority of his upstart political regime. The more radical, independent painter Géricault (1791-1824) liked Delaroche's early work for its similarities to the dramatic color and lighting of Gros. \\r\\nBy the late 1820s and early 1830s Delaroche changed course to depict English history subjects, which won him wide fame and considerable prices. The first of these paintings, The Death of Queen Elizabeth of England (Musée du Louvre, Paris), appeared in the Salon of 1827-28, but the painter's greatest success came in the 1831 Salon, where he exhibited Cromwell Gazing into the Coffin of Charles I (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Nîmes) and The Children of Edward IV (Musée du Louvre, Paris). The latter painting portrayed the incipient murder of the two royal heirs by usurpers, but it was so popular that the French king, Louis-Philippe, himself an Orléans replacement for the Bourbon monarchs, bought it for 6,000 francs. The painting also inspired playwright Casimir Delavigne's successful drama Les enfants d'Édouard (The Children of Edward), first performed in 1833 and dedicated to Delaroche. \\r\\nBecause of the triumph of the 1831 Salon, Delaroche was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1832. In 1833 he was named professor to the École des Beaux-Arts and received a commission for scenes from the life of Mary Magdalene for the church of the Madeleine in Paris. For this latter project he wished to emulate Renaissance frescoes and so went to Italy to study them. Upon his return, he learned that he would share the commission with another artist and withdrew from the project. After the negative criticism of his St. Cecilia at the 1837 Salon, Delaroche did not exhibit again in the Salons. But in that same year he was awarded his most important commission, the decoration of the hemicycle (auditorium) of the École des Beaux-Arts, which took him four years to complete. This work was considered a success by most conservative and moderate critics. With the 1840s portraiture became a substantial part of his production. At the end of his life, he had begun a four-picture series of scenes from the life of the Virgin and completed one (The Virgin Contemplating the Crown of Thorns, 1856). Delaroche's teaching atelier attracted a variety of young artists, such as Couture (q.v.), Gérôme (q.v.), and Millet (q.v.).

In 1827 he entered the Paris École des Beaux-Arts but was expelled two years later over a dispute with a professor. Nanteuil befriended Victor Hugo and started designing frontispieces for the author's writings. Accompanied by Théophile Gautier, Nanteuil was present at the famous Bataille d'Hernani in 1830, when Victor Hugo's unconventional poetic drama was loudly booed by the traditionalists but so hailed by its partisans that it paved the way for the young romantics' success. Endowed with a lively imagination, Nanteuil throughout his life interpreted writers, musicians, and poets, making prints in an often gothic style that matched the historicizing texts. Using either lithography or etching, he also made numerous reproductions of the paintings of his contemporaries, among them Couture (q.v.), Decamps (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), and Meissonier (q.v.). Even if his richest form of expression remains his printmaking, Nanteuil was also a painter. Unfortunately, most of his painted oeuvre has disappeared. For this reason, In the Forest is especially important as evidence of Nanteuil's painterly activity.

Their first exhibition occurred in 1891, and they were later joined by Ker-Xavier Roussel (1867-1944) and Vuillard (q.v.).

Since 1967 he has been an associate for the magnum photo agency and made extensive photo essays in the late 1960s-70s on the civil rights movement (The Movement, 1964), the Chicago Outlaws Motorcycle Club, of which he was a member (The Bikeriders, 1968), the demolition of historic 19th-century buildings in New York City (The Destruction of Lower Manhattan, 1969), and Texas prisons (Conversations with the Dead, 1971). For that series, Lyon included with his black-and-white photographs excerpts from handwritten letters, drawings, police reports, and telegrams. In 1977 the U.S. Justice Department used his images in a landmark legal case (Ruiz vs. Estelle) to improve conditions in prisons throughout Texas. Since the 1980s, Lyon has traveled to Colombia to photograph street children and prostitutes (The Paper Negative, 1980) and to Haiti to cover the events leading up to the collapse of the Duvalier regime in 1986. His own family has also become a continued subject of his work. Parallel to his photography, Lyon has made numerous films that are shown regularly in universities across the United States: Social Sciences 127 (1969), Llanito (1971), El Mojado (1973), Los Niños Abandonados (1975), Dear Mark (1975-80), Little Boy (1977), Willie (1986-87), and Media Man (c. 1993).

      "[{'id': 1600, 'description': 'Gustave Courbet (French, 1819–1877)', 'extent': None, 'qualifier': 'after', 'role': None, 'biography': 'Born into a wealthy farmer\\'s family, Courbet began his training in 1831 at the Petit Séminaire in Ornans where, beginning in 1833, he studied under \"le père Baud,\" who had been a pupil of Gros (q.v.). He was befriended by poet Max Buchon, who would later write the first article on Courbet, claiming that he was the artist for the people. In 1837, hoping that Gustave would become a lawyer, his father sent him to the Collège Royal in Besançon. Despite his father\\'s ambitions, Courbet began to study art at the academy there with Charles-Antoine Flageoulot (1774-1840), a former student of David (q.v.). By 1839 Courbet had moved to Paris to pursue a career in art. He refrained from entering the École des Beaux-Arts, studying instead briefly with Charles de Steuben (1788-1856) and preferring to learn how to paint by copying the works of the Old Masters in the museums. Courbet also wanted to work after life models and enrolled at the Académie Suisse. He began to submit paintings to the Salon, the majority of which were rejected. In 1846-47 Courbet traveled to the Netherlands where he studied the works of Rembrandt and Hals. The following year ten of his paintings were shown at the Salon, and together with his friends Baudelaire, Champfleury, and Buchon he became labeled a \"realist.\" Courbet\\'s paintings shown at the 1851 Salon-Stonebreakers (1849, formerly Dresden Gemäldegalerie, destroyed during World War II), Peasants of Flagey (1850-55, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Besançon), and The Burial at Ornans (1849-50, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris)-elicited criticism. Because Courbet represented the peasants as he saw them, without ennobling or idealizing them, his works met with disapproval. Moreover, these representations of peasants appeared at a time when the upper classes felt threatened by social unrest and by the instability of the republic. In 1855 Courbet financed an independent Pavillon du Réalisme near the Universal Exposition, where he showed his Painter\\'s Studio (1854-55, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris). He began to travel extensively, including visits to Gent, Brussels, Antwerp, Bruges, Cologne, Mainz, and Strasbourg. He returned to Germany in 1858, and while in Frankfurt, he began to paint the stag hunts he witnessed. The following year he visited the Normandy coast, painting seascapes, some of which became almost abstractions. Courbet turned to still lifes in 1862-63 when visiting the Saintonge area, yet he still continued to create landscapes and portraits. By 1870 he was offered the Legion of Honor but refused it because of his opposition to the imperial government. During the Paris Commune from March to May 1871, Courbet became an active member of the government. As chairman of the Commission for the Protection of the Artistic Monuments of Paris, he suggested the Vendôme Column be dismantled because it was an imperial symbol. The Commune decided instead to topple the column. When the Commune was defeated, Courbet was held responsible for this act of vandalism and was jailed for six months. In 1873 the government decided to rebuild the column at Courbet\\'s expense. Unable to pay and fearful of being arrested, Courbet moved to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of his life in exile.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1819', 'death_year': '1877'}, {'id': 5538, 'description': 'Félix Bracquemond (French, 1833–1914)', 'extent': None, 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'artist', 'biography': None, 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1833', 'death_year': '1914'}]\n",

In 1850 he left Grenoble and moved to Paris to study under Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897), an innovative and nontraditional instructor who developed and published his own unique teaching method based on painting and drawing from memory. Fantin studied with him for six years and then attended the École des Beaux-Arts for less than a year in 1854. Encouraged by J. A. M. Whistler (1834-1903), whom he met in 1858 at the Louvre, Fantin-Latour made several trips to London from 1859 to 1881, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy. London collectors appreciated his still lifes, and he began accepting numerous portrait commissions from English patrons. It was in London, through Whistler\\'s brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910), that Fantin first learned to etch. After his first Salon submissions were rejected in 1859, Fantin, in an effort to become better known in France, began exhibiting with his friend Manet (q.v.) and future impressionists Renoir (q.v.) and Monet (q.v.). In 1865 Fantin wrote collector Edwin Edwards: \"We form a group and make noise because there are lots of painters about and one is easily overlooked. When we get together . . . we gain strength in numbers and grow more adventurous. I thought it could last. That was my mistake.\" Unlike the realists and the impressionists, Fantin did not paint out of doors; rather, he preferred literary subjects, still lifes, and portraits that could be painted in his studio. In addition to portraits and still lifes, he made numerous paintings and more than 150 prints that were fantasy works and dream visions, paving the way for symbolist artists.

Just like Alma Tadema (q.v.), Tissot, in his early career, was influenced by Belgian history painter Henry Leys (1815-1869), which resulted in such paintings as those illustrating Goethe's Faust (1808-32). In Paris he became close friends with J. A. M. Whistler (1834-1903), Degas (q.v.), and later Morisot (q.v.) and Manet (q.v.). Tissot made his debut at the Salon of 1859, and in 1864 he showed his first works depicting scenes of modern life. He became quite successful, and by 1865 his financial troubles had disappeared. His fame had already spread to the other side of the Channel, and in 1864 he exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in London. Intrigued by Japanese art, Tissot amassed a renowned collection and painted some fashionable japonaiseries. In 1870 he fought in the Franco-Prussian War and joined the Paris Commune. He left the war-ravaged city in 1871 for London, where his success continued. Degas asked him to participate in the first impressionist exhibition in 1874, but he declined. Around 1875 he met Kathleen Newton, who became his companion until her death at age twenty-eight. Overcome with grief, he moved back to Paris. There he had a large solo exhibition in 1883 at the Palais de l'Industrie, showing paintings, works on paper, and enamels. Two years later he exhibited Quinze tableaux sur la femme à Paris, depicting the life of the modern urban woman. From that point on, Tissot became deeply involved with spiritualism and religion.

Along with her sister Edma, she began her studies with Geoffroy-Alphonse Chocarne (act. 1838-1857), a painter trained in the neoclassical tradition. In 1858 the sisters entered the studio of Joseph-Benoît Guichard (1806-1880), a student of Ingres (q.v.) and Delacroix (q.v.). Through Guichard they met Corot (q.v.) in 1861, under whose encouragement they began to paint out of doors near Pontoise as well as in Normandy and Brittany. Berthe Morisot exhibited at the Salon from 1864 until 1873. Fantin-Latour (q.v.) introduced her to Manet (q.v.) around 1867. They developed a close friendship, and Morisot modeled for him many times (see Manet, Berthe Morisot, no. 141). In 1874 she married his brother, Eugène, and that same year began participating in the impressionist exhibitions, never to show at the Salon again. Four years after their marriage, the couple's only child, Julie, was born on 14 November 1878 and would become a main source of artistic inspiration. Morisot matured as a central member of the group of impressionists. Her home became a meeting place for painters and writers alike, including Renoir (q.v.), Degas (q.v.), Mary Cassatt (1845-1926), and Stéphane Mallarmé. She participated in the Drouot sale of 1875, where the artists were ridiculed extensively. Her paintings, however, fetched slightly higher prices than those of Renoir, Monet (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.). Morisot made pastels and watercolors as well as oil paintings, and during the final years of her life she experimented with lithography and drypoint etching.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1841', 'death_year': '1895'}]\n",

She briefly worked as a trapeze artist in a circus in the beginning of the 1880s, but a fall forced her to look for another occupation. She then began working as a model, posing for Henner (q.v.), Puvis de Chavannes (q.v.), Renoir (q.v.), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), and several other painters. Around this time she chose to be called Suzanne. In 1883, when she was eighteen years old, she gave birth to a son, future painter Maurice Utrillo (1883-1955). Encouraged by Degas (q.v.) and Renoir, she became a full-time painter in 1896, financially supported by her new husband, Paul Mousis. Degas taught her printmaking and introduced her to the dealers Durand-Ruel and Vollard. Valadon divorced Mousis in 1909 to marry André Utter (1886-1948), a painter and a friend of her son.

At age thirteen Renoir apprenticed with the porcelain decorators Levy Frères &amp; Cie. He earned money by painting fans, blinds, and murals for cafés. In 1860 he registered to copy Old Master paintings in the Louvre and, the following year, entered the studio of Charles Gleyre (1806-1874), where he met Frédéric Bazille (1841-1870), Monet (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.). In 1862 he was also accepted at the École des Beaux-Arts. With his friends from Gleyre's studio, he began working en plein air and, during a visit to the forest of Fontainebleau, was introduced to Diaz de la Peña (q.v.). After a failed attempt in 1863, Renoir's first painting was accepted at the Salon of 1864, the same year he painted Cleveland's portrait of Romaine Lacaux. More typical of this early period, however, is the painting Diana the Huntress (1867, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which reveals Courbet's (q.v.) influence. Around 1867 Renoir shared a studio with Bazille and Monet, the latter becoming an important influence on his art. Renoir and Monet's comparable impressionist style during this period is evident in two paintings each made at La grenouillère (all four titled La grenouillère, 1869: Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, and Pushkin Museum, Moscow [Renoir]; National Gallery, London, and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [Monet]),1 a bathing establishment on the Seine. After Renoir's military service during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), Monet introduced him to the dealer Durand-Ruel, who began purchasing his works. Renoir's submissions to the Salon were regularly refused, which encouraged him to participate in the first impressionist exhibition in 1874 and the 1875 auction at Hôtel Drouot, where his works were ridiculed by the critics. At the third impressionist exhibition in 1877, he showed Ball at the Moulin de la Galette (1876, Musée d'Orsay, Paris), in which he addressed a subject of modern life, one of his most characteristic impressionist paintings on a grand scale, with a rich pattern of light and shadow. In 1878 he returned to the Salon and became quite successful, establishing his reputation as a portraitist (1878, Mme Charpentier and her Children, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He continued to use this official venue for the next several years, declining to exhibit with the impressionists. This decision was partly generated by the fact that his newfound clientele would be more appreciative of his participating in the Salon. He was supported by his patrons, particularly the Charpentiers, owners of a publishing house, whose journal La vie moderne furthered Renoir's reputation. After a trip to North Africa and Italy in 1881, he joined Cézanne at L'Estaque. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s Renoir traveled extensively through Brittany, Normandy, Provence, and Spain. In the mid-1880s he began to experiment with more linear contours, the application of thinner paint layers, and smoother brush strokes. This so-called Ingresque period, which had a very mixed reception, lasted for about six years. He then reflected upon the achievements of the Old Masters and favored a more fluid style, after which he returned to using broader brush strokes and more vibrant colors. In 1886 he was given a one-man show by Durand-Ruel. By 1900 Renoir was an established artist: he became Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1900 and four years later was honored at the Salon d'Automne with a gallery devoted to his works. Beginning in 1912 he suffered from rheumatism and began using a wheelchair, yet he continued to work until the end of his life. He now often stayed in southern France, where he owned property in Cagnes-sur-Mer. Renoir regularly exhibited his works at the Durand-Ruel and Bernheim-Jeune galleries in Paris, as well as elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1841', 'death_year': '1919'}]\n",

In 1886 he enrolled at the Académie Julian, where he was taught by Tony Robert-Fleury (1837-1911) and Bouguereau (q.v.). The following year he was accepted into the École des Beaux-Arts and was briefly in the atelier of Gérôme (q.v.). At this time he also studied seventeenth-century Dutch painting and the works of Chardin (1699-1779). By 1889 Vuillard was persuaded by his friend painter and theorist Maurice Denis (1870-1943) to join the newly formed group of artists known as the Nabis. The Nabis based many of their ideas on synthetism, first developed by Gauguin (q.v.) and Émile Bernard (1868-1941), in which the artist was to work not from nature but from memory. Vuillard's initial synthetist works reveal a preoccupation with pattern and bright colors, denying the three-dimensionality of the object. By 1892, however, his colors were more subdued, reflecting his desire to mimic the unusual lighting effects that he had seen in symbolist theater. Vuillard's first major commissions date from this time, including nine panels for the dining room of Alexandre Natanson and four decorative panels for the library of Dr. Henri Vaquez. In 1898 Vuillard visited Venice and Florence, and the following year he and Bonnard (q.v.), a fellow member of the Nabis, made an excursion to London. Later they went to Milan and Venice and eventually to Spain. Vuillard also made trips to Brittany and Normandy. His first public commission came in 1912, when he was asked to paint panels for the foyer of the Comédie des Champs-Elysées in Paris. During that period he moved beyond the synthetism of the Nabis and returned to a more traditional perspective. At the same time he was accepting commissions for portraits. In 1936 he was chosen to paint a mural at the Palais des Nations in Geneva and was subsequently elected to the Institut de France.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1868', 'death_year': '1940'}]\n",

Sérusier, after having returned from studying with Gauguin in Pont-Aven, decided to form his own artistic group called the Nabis (Hebrew: prophets). The founding members of the Nabis included Denis, who wrote the manifesto for the group, \"Définition du néo-traditionnisme\" (published in May 1890 in Art et critique), Bonnard, Paul Ranson (1864-1909), and Henri-Gabriel Ibels (1867-1936). Their first exhibition occurred in 1891, and they were later joined by Ker-Xavier Roussel (1867-1944) and Vuillard (q.v.). Based loosely on the synthetist goals established by Gauguin and Émile Bernard, the movement was created from Sérusier\\'s vision of an artistic brotherhood dedicated to symbolism whereby a universal language could be expressed through symbols. The Nabis were opposed to the naturalism taught at academies by artists such as Bouguereau (q.v.) and wanted to move away from didactic and moral paintings toward a more decorative style characterized by simplified drawing, flat patches of color, and heavy set contours. Bonnard\\'s works of the 1890s were influenced by the innovations of Gauguin as well as Japanese prints, which were easily accessible in nineteenth-century Paris. His paintings took on a decorative quality, mirroring his artistic expressions in other media such as stained glass, furniture, pottery, and painted screens. Bonnard\\'s and Vuillard\\'s domestic interior paintings of the 1890s were often described using the term intimisme. In 1891 Bonnard also experimented with other media, including poster designs and lithographs, which inspired his friend Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), whom he had met through La revue blanche, a magazine that published the Nabis\\' work. Around 1900 the members of the Nabis began to drift apart. Between 1905 and 1910 Bonnard and Vuillard traveled to England, Belgium, Holland, Spain, and Italy, visiting many museums. Bonnard\\'s art began to gravitate toward impressionism, but his colors were more expressive and his compositions more overtly structured; elements of the painted interiors such as doors, windows or pieces of furniture often provided a strong compositional framework. He also worked extensively with photographs. His late works were acclaimed by fellow Parisians like Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and Paul Signac (1863-1935). After 1920 Bonnard exhibited extensively and became an internationally renowned artist, receiving much recognition in the United States, where he traveled in 1926.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1867', 'death_year': '1947'}, {'id': 28934, 'description': 'Auguste Clot (French, 1858–1936)', 'extent': 'printed by', 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'printer', 'biography': None, 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1858', 'death_year': '1936'}, {'id': 291938, 'description': 'Ambroise Vollard (French, 1867–1939)', 'extent': 'published by', 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'publisher', 'biography': 'French art dealer and publisher, 1867-1939', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1867', 'death_year': '1939'}]\n",

At this time he also studied seventeenth-century Dutch painting and the works of Chardin (1699-1779). By 1889 Vuillard was persuaded by his friend painter and theorist Maurice Denis (1870-1943) to join the newly formed group of artists known as the Nabis. The Nabis based many of their ideas on synthetism, first developed by Gauguin (q.v.) and Émile Bernard (1868-1941), in which the artist was to work not from nature but from memory. Vuillard's initial synthetist works reveal a preoccupation with pattern and bright colors, denying the three-dimensionality of the object. By 1892, however, his colors were more subdued, reflecting his desire to mimic the unusual lighting effects that he had seen in symbolist theater. Vuillard's first major commissions date from this time, including nine panels for the dining room of Alexandre Natanson and four decorative panels for the library of Dr. Henri Vaquez. In 1898 Vuillard visited Venice and Florence, and the following year he and Bonnard (q.v.), a fellow member of the Nabis, made an excursion to London.

In 1886 he enrolled at the Académie Julian, where he was taught by Tony Robert-Fleury (1837-1911) and Bouguereau (q.v.). The following year he was accepted into the École des Beaux-Arts and was briefly in the atelier of Gérôme (q.v.). At this time he also studied seventeenth-century Dutch painting and the works of Chardin (1699-1779). By 1889 Vuillard was persuaded by his friend painter and theorist Maurice Denis (1870-1943) to join the newly formed group of artists known as the Nabis. The Nabis based many of their ideas on synthetism, first developed by Gauguin (q.v.) and Émile Bernard (1868-1941), in which the artist was to work not from nature but from memory. Vuillard's initial synthetist works reveal a preoccupation with pattern and bright colors, denying the three-dimensionality of the object. By 1892, however, his colors were more subdued, reflecting his desire to mimic the unusual lighting effects that he had seen in symbolist theater. Vuillard's first major commissions date from this time, including nine panels for the dining room of Alexandre Natanson and four decorative panels for the library of Dr. Henri Vaquez. In 1898 Vuillard visited Venice and Florence, and the following year he and Bonnard (q.v.), a fellow member of the Nabis, made an excursion to London. Later they went to Milan and Venice and eventually to Spain. Vuillard also made trips to Brittany and Normandy. His first public commission came in 1912, when he was asked to paint panels for the foyer of the Comédie des Champs-Elysées in Paris. During that period he moved beyond the synthetism of the Nabis and returned to a more traditional perspective. At the same time he was accepting commissions for portraits. In 1936 he was chosen to paint a mural at the Palais des Nations in Geneva and was subsequently elected to the Institut de France.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1868', 'death_year': '1940'}]\n",

Celebrating the nuances of light and composition in his images, which are primarily black and white, he is a careful and thoughtful technician. He digests, rather than dramatizes, his subjects, often spending several years exploring a theme before completing it. Born in Boston, Clift first took an interest in photography at age 10, building his own darkroom. As a teenager, he attended a workshop with Paul Caponigro. Beginning in 1962, Clift spent eight years specializing in architectural subjects, commissioned on a freelance basis by various organizations -- including the Massachusetts Council on the Arts for an extensive documentation of Old Boston City Hall (1970). He moved to Santa Fe in 1971 and began to photograph the landscape that continues to inspire his work. He has been awarded fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts (1972, 1979) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1973, 1980). Returning to Boston in 1975, Clift photographed the architecture of Beacon Hill. During 1975-76 he worked for the Joseph Seagram and Son's bicentennial project on American county courthouses. In 1977 he traveled to France to take pictures of Mont-Saint-Michel and began an ongoing project picturing the sculpture of Juan Hamilton.

Her early 4 x 5-inch, black-and-white photographs reflect the influence of the California-based f/64 school, which included Ansel Adams and, in particular, Imogen Cunningham, whom Dater credits as a mentor. When Cunningham died in 1976, Dater embarked on a project to photograph and interview her relatives and friends, acting as editor for the resulting publication, Imogen Cunningham: A Portrait (1979). Dater's color work includes subjects from Egypt (1979-80) and a series of self-portraits that depict the artist in various guises as a means for critical feminist inquiry (1982). More recently, she has moved to computer-manipulated photography and installation and performance art.\\r\\n\\tDater (born Judy Rose Lichtenfield in Hollywood, California) attended ucla (1959-62), where she studied drawing and painting.

Metzker American, 1931-\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a student of Arthur Siegel, Aaron Siskind, and Harry Callahan in Chicago at the Institute of Design, Illinois Institute of Technology, Ray Metzker was influenced by the spirit of photographic experimentation at the \"New Bauhaus.\" Extending photography\\'s formal vocabulary beyond description and into the realm of visual puzzles, Metzker is best known for his creative use of pattern, high tonal contrast, focus, print size, and composition. He first explored these issues in his single-image work of the 1950s, moving in the 1960s to make multiframe assemblages that juxtaposed highly contrasted fragments of figures, objects, and architectural elements to create kinetic patterns and mosaic grids. Envisioning an entire roll of film as one negative, Metzker describes his Composites series as an explanation of \"the potential of the black-and-white still photograph to deal with the complexity of succession and simultaneity.\"\\r\\n\\tMetzker resumed the single-image format in a series of New Mexican landscapes during the early 1970s, fusing high-contrast blocks created by buildings, leaves, and his own shadow with subjects rendered in the more traditional gradation of black-and-white tones. His Pictus Interruptus series of 1977 continued the play of tone and perspective, wherein objects placed close to the lens appeared blurred, obscuring scenic backdrops views of Greece and Philadelphia. In 1989, with the assistance of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and a residency from the La Napoule Foundation, Metzker photographed in the south of France for his series titled Sojourn. In this and his later series In Nature\\'s Realm (1994), he continued to explore the photographic interplay of natural textures and forms.\\r\\n\\tBorn in Milwaukee, Metzker earned a B.A. in art from Beloit College (1953) and an M.S. in photography from the Institute of Design, Illinois Institute of Technology (1959). His work has been featured in one-person exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago (1959, 1985, 1991), the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1967), the Milwaukee Art Center (1970), the International Center of Photography, New York (1978), the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (1984), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1985), the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1985), the High Museum of Art, Atlanta (1986), George Eastman House, Rochester (1986), the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C (1986), and the Cleveland Museum of Art (1991).

Cuba, 1948- Havana-born Abe Morell became interested in photography while a student of John McKee at Bowdoin College in Maine (B.A., 1977). Fascinated by the surreal, he initially produced manipulated prints of outlandish scenarios. The work of Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, however, showed Morell \"that straight photography could pack more surrealism into a picture\" than he could achieve through manipulation. Adopting a 35mm straight technique, in 1978 he traveled to Miami and New York to work as a street photographer in the vein of Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, continuing in this format at Yale University (M.F.A., 1981). In the late 1980s, Morell began two series for which he is best known: large-scale black-and-white photographs of interior spaces made with a self-built camera obscura, and still lifes of pictures of the pictures in books. The images provide clever post-modern commentary on the nature of photographic representation by referencing the medium\\'s beginnings while simultaneously celebrating the ephemeral magic of light and shadow. Devoid of human subjects, these psychologically complex interior landscapes allude to the changing spheres of childhood and family, and our understanding of history itself, in contemporary middle-class society. Morell has received fellowships from the Cintas Foundation (1992-93) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1993-94).

In 1922, while at Columbia University Teachers College in her native New York City, Bourke-White studied photography with Clarence White. She attended several other colleges before graduating from Cornell University (1927), then moved to Cleveland. The city's industrial landscape was influential in the development of Bourke-White's photographic style. One of her images from this period, Romance of Steel, was a first-place winner in the Cleveland Museum of Art's 1928 May Show, a regional juried exhibition. The following year Bourke-White moved back to New York to work for Henry Luce's new business magazine, Fortune. In 1934 she was sent by the magazine to cover the drought in the Midwest, an assignment she credited with awakening her social conscience. Three years later she collaborated with writer Erskine Caldwell on You Have Seen Their Faces, an acclaimed study of the plight of rural Southerners during the Great Depression. Bourke-White's long association with Life began in 1936 when she joined the magazine as one of its first staff photographers. When it premiered on November 23, 1936, her photographs of Fort Peck Dam in Montana were featured on the cover and in the lead story. During her career, Bourke-White covered many major world events: the Great Depression, World War II, the partitioning of India, and the Korean War. She continued to photograph throughout the 1950s, publishing her images in magazines and in a number of books, including Eyes on Russia (1931), North of the Danube, with Erskine Caldwell (1939), Say, Is This the U.S.A.?, with Erskine Caldwell (1941), Shooting the Russian War (1942), Dear Fatherland, Rest Quietly (1946), Halfway to Freedom: A Report on the New India (1949), and Portrait of Myself (her autobiography, 1963).

This exhibition surveys an impressive body of work created between 1985 and 1995. During that time the Cleveland-born artist made seven trips to France to photograph what remains of the architectural achievements that flourished there in the 12th and 13th centuries under the Cistercian order. The monks' quest for an inward-looking life that emphasized liturgy, sacred reading, and manual labor was brilliantly facilitated by an architecture of minimal spaces, devoid of vivid color and narrative decoration. Using his keen ability to compose and light his subjects, Heald accentuated the simple directness of structural shapes, methods of construction, and exquisitely proportioned rooms. His serene images capture the distinguishing quality of Cistercian architecture and monastic life: silence. From 1974 to 1981 David Heald worked in the photography studio of the Cleveland Museum of Art before moving to New York where he is chief photographer of the Guggenheim Museum.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1951', 'death_year': None}]\n",

As he photographed an African American soldier guarding the border, it struck Freed that this man was risking his life to defend a country that limited his own rights. Freed returned to New York to undertake a multiyear exploration of African American life. Freed began shooting around New York, and then traveled extensively throughout the South. He spent time in communities getting to know his subjects, and kept a journal recording his impressions and their stories and words. During these years, he also covered Martin Luther King Jr. and numerous civil rights events, but when Freed published <em>Black in White America</em> in 1968, the book focused instead on the fabric of daily life. As a photojournalist, Freed was an observer rather than a participant, but not an impartial one. He believed that “photography is about who you are.

Since 1967 he has been an associate for the magnum photo agency and made extensive photo essays in the late 1960s-70s on the civil rights movement (The Movement, 1964), the Chicago Outlaws Motorcycle Club, of which he was a member (The Bikeriders, 1968), the demolition of historic 19th-century buildings in New York City (The Destruction of Lower Manhattan, 1969), and Texas prisons (Conversations with the Dead, 1971). For that series, Lyon included with his black-and-white photographs excerpts from handwritten letters, drawings, police reports, and telegrams. In 1977 the U.S. Justice Department used his images in a landmark legal case (Ruiz vs. Estelle) to improve conditions in prisons throughout Texas. Since the 1980s, Lyon has traveled to Colombia to photograph street children and prostitutes (The Paper Negative, 1980) and to Haiti to cover the events leading up to the collapse of the Duvalier regime in 1986. His own family has also become a continued subject of his work. Parallel to his photography, Lyon has made numerous films that are shown regularly in universities across the United States: Social Sciences 127 (1969), Llanito (1971), El Mojado (1973), Los Niños Abandonados (1975), Dear Mark (1975-80), Little Boy (1977), Willie (1986-87), and Media Man (c. 1993).

Graduating from City College of New York in 1926, Siskind taught English in the city's public schools for 23 years. He took up photography as a hobby in 1930 and two years later learned to process and print his own images. Around this time he joined the Photo League, an organization of socially concerned photographers who promoted documentary photography. Siskind headed the league's project focusing on Harlem (Harlem Document) and also produced his own series Tabernacle City, Bucks County and The Most Crowded Block in the World. In the early 1940s, Siskind's work gradually shifted from a social documentary approach to a more abstract and personal style. During summers on Martha's Vineyard and in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he began photographing natural objects close up, eliminating deep, naturalistic space and concentrating on the primacy of the flat, two-dimensional surface of the photograph. As a result of his experiments, he came to be interested in the photograph as a physical object in its own right, rather than as a reflection of the outside world.

He attended the College of Music at Boston University (1950-51) but left when drafted into the army.

Although Caponigro gradually moved away from White's teachings to pursue his own pictorial ideals, the two artists found shared inspiration in the philosophies of G. I. Gurdjeiff.

Graduating from City College of New York in 1926, Siskind taught English in the city's public schools for 23 years. He took up photography as a hobby in 1930 and two years later learned to process and print his own images. Around this time he joined the Photo League, an organization of socially concerned photographers who promoted documentary photography. Siskind headed the league's project focusing on Harlem (Harlem Document) and also produced his own series Tabernacle City, Bucks County and The Most Crowded Block in the World. In the early 1940s, Siskind's work gradually shifted from a social documentary approach to a more abstract and personal style. During summers on Martha's Vineyard and in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he began photographing natural objects close up, eliminating deep, naturalistic space and concentrating on the primacy of the flat, two-dimensional surface of the photograph. As a result of his experiments, he came to be interested in the photograph as a physical object in its own right, rather than as a reflection of the outside world. In 1947 Siskind exhibited his new work at the Egan Gallery in New York, where the paintings of the abstract expressionists were shown. He became friends with painter Franz Kline and other members of his circle and through their support published his first book, Aaron Siskind: Photographs (1959). In the 1950s Siskind also began to establish himself as a photography teacher. He gained his first experience as a part-time instructor at Trenton College (1949-51), then taught during the summer of 1951 at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. There he worked with Harry Callahan, who invited him to join the staff of the Institute of Design in Chicago. Siskind taught at the institute from 1951-71, when he left to join the Rhode Island School of Design where Callahan now headed the department of photography. Siskind continued to teach at the school until his retirement in 1976.

Working almost exclusively in large formats, he often makes close-cropped abstractions of light, form, and shadow as a way to discover and reveal hidden or symbolic meanings in his subjects. Like Ansel Adams, Caponigro (born in Boston) was a talented pianist who abandoned a career in music but never its fundamental principles -- such as rhythm, harmony, and counterpoint -- as fodder for creative expression. He attended the College of Music at Boston University (1950-51) but left when drafted into the army. Stationed in San Francisco, he met Benjamin Chin, who was working in the same photography lab on the base and who introduced him to the teachings of Ansel Adams and Minor White. Caponigro continued his study with Chin and Alfred W. Richter at the California School of Fine Arts (1956) and studied with White for six months at the Rochester Institute of Technology (1957-58). In 1958 photographer Walter Chappell organized Caponigro's first one-person exhibition, In the Presence Of, at George Eastman House, Rochester. Although Caponigro gradually moved away from White's teachings to pursue his own pictorial ideals, the two artists found shared inspiration in the philosophies of G. I. Gurdjeiff. Emphasizing Eastern religious thought and meditation, Gurdjeiff encouraged the extended study of ancient religious sites as a means for obtaining inner harmony. Following these ideas, Caponigro traveled on a 1966 fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to Ireland and the British Isles, photographing medieval churches, Celtic crosses, and the prehistoric monuments for which he is so well known.

Graduating from City College of New York in 1926, Siskind taught English in the city's public schools for 23 years. He took up photography as a hobby in 1930 and two years later learned to process and print his own images. Around this time he joined the Photo League, an organization of socially concerned photographers who promoted documentary photography. Siskind headed the league's project focusing on Harlem (Harlem Document) and also produced his own series Tabernacle City, Bucks County and The Most Crowded Block in the World. In the early 1940s, Siskind's work gradually shifted from a social documentary approach to a more abstract and personal style. During summers on Martha's Vineyard and in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he began photographing natural objects close up, eliminating deep, naturalistic space and concentrating on the primacy of the flat, two-dimensional surface of the photograph. As a result of his experiments, he came to be interested in the photograph as a physical object in its own right, rather than as a reflection of the outside world. In 1947 Siskind exhibited his new work at the Egan Gallery in New York, where the paintings of the abstract expressionists were shown. He became friends with painter Franz Kline and other members of his circle and through their support published his first book, Aaron Siskind: Photographs (1959).

Since the 1980s, Lyon has traveled to Colombia to photograph street children and prostitutes (The Paper Negative, 1980) and to Haiti to cover the events leading up to the collapse of the Duvalier regime in 1986. His own family has also become a continued subject of his work. Parallel to his photography, Lyon has made numerous films that are shown regularly in universities across the United States: Social Sciences 127 (1969), Llanito (1971), El Mojado (1973), Los Niños Abandonados (1975), Dear Mark (1975-80), Little Boy (1977), Willie (1986-87), and Media Man (c. 1993). He has published his own works since 1988 under the imprint Bleak Beauty Books, in collaboration with his wife, Nancy Lyon, and Michael Hausman. Lyon has also taught nonfiction film at the State University of New York at Buffalo (1986) and at Columbia University (1987-90). Among his honors are fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1969, 1979) and the Rockefeller Foundation (1990). He has had one-person exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago (1966, 1969), the Newport Harbor Art Museum in California (1973), and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1982).

Graduating from City College of New York in 1926, Siskind taught English in the city's public schools for 23 years. He took up photography as a hobby in 1930 and two years later learned to process and print his own images. Around this time he joined the Photo League, an organization of socially concerned photographers who promoted documentary photography. Siskind headed the league's project focusing on Harlem (Harlem Document) and also produced his own series Tabernacle City, Bucks County and The Most Crowded Block in the World. In the early 1940s, Siskind's work gradually shifted from a social documentary approach to a more abstract and personal style. During summers on Martha's Vineyard and in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he began photographing natural objects close up, eliminating deep, naturalistic space and concentrating on the primacy of the flat, two-dimensional surface of the photograph. As a result of his experiments, he came to be interested in the photograph as a physical object in its own right, rather than as a reflection of the outside world. In 1947 Siskind exhibited his new work at the Egan Gallery in New York, where the paintings of the abstract expressionists were shown. He became friends with painter Franz Kline and other members of his circle and through their support published his first book, Aaron Siskind: Photographs (1959). In the 1950s Siskind also began to establish himself as a photography teacher.

Graduating from City College of New York in 1926, Siskind taught English in the city's public schools for 23 years. He took up photography as a hobby in 1930 and two years later learned to process and print his own images. Around this time he joined the Photo League, an organization of socially concerned photographers who promoted documentary photography. Siskind headed the league's project focusing on Harlem (Harlem Document) and also produced his own series Tabernacle City, Bucks County and The Most Crowded Block in the World. In the early 1940s, Siskind's work gradually shifted from a social documentary approach to a more abstract and personal style. During summers on Martha's Vineyard and in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he began photographing natural objects close up, eliminating deep, naturalistic space and concentrating on the primacy of the flat, two-dimensional surface of the photograph. As a result of his experiments, he came to be interested in the photograph as a physical object in its own right, rather than as a reflection of the outside world. In 1947 Siskind exhibited his new work at the Egan Gallery in New York, where the paintings of the abstract expressionists were shown. He became friends with painter Franz Kline and other members of his circle and through their support published his first book, Aaron Siskind: Photographs (1959). In the 1950s Siskind also began to establish himself as a photography teacher. He gained his first experience as a part-time instructor at Trenton College (1949-51), then taught during the summer of 1951 at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. There he worked with Harry Callahan, who invited him to join the staff of the Institute of Design in Chicago. Siskind taught at the institute from 1951-71, when he left to join the Rhode Island School of Design where Callahan now headed the department of photography.

After studying painting in the 1920s (including one year with cubist André Lhote), Cartier-Bresson became interested in photography while recuperating from illness in 1930-31. Working first with a box camera and then with a 35mm Leica camera, he began to take pictures for magazines and newspapers. In the early 1930s his photographs were featured in exhibitions at the Julian Levy Gallery in New York and the Club Atheneo in Madrid.

Three years later, while serving in the French army during World War II, he was captured by the Germans. He escaped from prison in 1943 and joined the French resistance. Following the war his work was featured in a major one-artist exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1946), and in 1947 he joined Ropert Capa, George Rodger, and David Seymour in founding magnum Photos, the well-known cooperative agency for photojournalism.\\r\\n\\tOver the next two decades Cartier-Bresson traveled the world as a freelance photojournalist.

Cuba, 1948- Havana-born Abe Morell became interested in photography while a student of John McKee at Bowdoin College in Maine (B.A., 1977). Fascinated by the surreal, he initially produced manipulated prints of outlandish scenarios. The work of Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, however, showed Morell \"that straight photography could pack more surrealism into a picture\" than he could achieve through manipulation. Adopting a 35mm straight technique, in 1978 he traveled to Miami and New York to work as a street photographer in the vein of Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, continuing in this format at Yale University (M.F.A., 1981). In the late 1980s, Morell began two series for which he is best known: large-scale black-and-white photographs of interior spaces made with a self-built camera obscura, and still lifes of pictures of the pictures in books. The images provide clever post-modern commentary on the nature of photographic representation by referencing the medium\\'s beginnings while simultaneously celebrating the ephemeral magic of light and shadow. Devoid of human subjects, these psychologically complex interior landscapes allude to the changing spheres of childhood and family, and our understanding of history itself, in contemporary middle-class society. Morell has received fellowships from the Cintas Foundation (1992-93) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1993-94).

He also pioneered in bringing modern art to this country through the avant-garde European and American work presented in the pages of his well-known journal, Camera Work, and at his gallery, \"291.\" Stieglitz (born in Hoboken, New Jersey) first became interested in photography in the early 1880s while studying mechanical engineering in Germany at the polytechnic institute in Charlottenburg (now a suburb of Berlin). Following a class with the great photochemist Hermann Wilhelm Vogel, Stieglitz turned his attention to photography and soon began writing technical articles on the subject for European journals. In 1887 he won a prize for a photograph submitted to the Holiday Work Competition sponsored by Amateur Photographer magazine. When he returned to the United States three years later, Stieglitz became a partner in the Photochrome Engraving Company; running a business did not interest him, however, and his association with the company lasted only five years. In addition to pursuing his own photographic work and writing articles on pictorial photography for various American journals during the 1890s, Stieglitz became editor of the American Amateur Photographer in 1893. Four years later he took on the editorship of Camera Notes, the journal of the newly formed Camera Club of New York. In 1902 Stieglitz organized the first Photo-Secession exhibition at the National Arts Club in New York, launching an organization that was to play a major role in the fight for recognition of photography as an art form. At the end of the year he began publishing Camera Work, the journal of the Photo-Secession, which soon became one of the premier photographic publications of the day (the first issue, dated January 1903, was published in December 1902). In 1905, with the assistance of painter and photographer Edward Steichen, Stieglitz opened the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue. The gallery, which soon became known as \"291,\" provided Stieglitz with a center from which to promote art photography and exhibit the work of its finest practitioners. In addition to presenting work by the most advanced American and European pictorial photographers, Stieglitz began showing the work of modern European artists, including Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Paul Cézanne. He also organized numerous exhibitions of art photography for museums and expositions in this country and in Europe, including the famous 1910 International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography at the Albright Art Gallery, Buffalo. After closing \"291\" in 1917, Stieglitz focused on his own work, beginning a series of portraits of artist Georgia O\\'Keeffe (whom he married in 1924) and a series of cloud pictures called Equivalents, which he exhibited in the 1920s at the Anderson Gallery in New York. During these years he also produced a group of photographs of New York City skyscrapers, as well as images of Lake George, New York. Stieglitz continued to photograph into the 1930s. He also ran two galleries from the mid-1920s until his death: the Intimate Gallery (1925-29) and An American Place (1929-46). Both galleries presented the work of a small group of American modernists, including O\\'Keeffe, Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, and Paul Strand, as well as Stieglitz\\'s photographs.

In 1910 Kalish enrolled in the National Academy of Design in New York. After returning to Cleveland in early 1912, he briefly shared a studio with William Zorach. Kalish traveled to Europe in 1912–13, studying at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Colarossi in Paris, and exhibiting in the Paris Salon (1913). He worked as a sculptor for the Panama-Specific Exposition in San Francisco, 1913–14, returning to Cleveland the following year. His first solo exhibition was at Korner &amp; Wood Galleries in Cleveland (1916). He served in the army during World War I. In 1921 he began creating bronze sculptures devoted to the theme of labor and completed the last in 1938. In 1923 Cleveland school children collected small change to fund the casting of Kalish’s large-scale monument to Abraham Lincoln, which was installed in front of the School Administration Building. During the 1920s his sculptures appeared in solo shows in Cleveland and New York. He participated in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1924–30) as well as the annuals of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia and the Art Institute of Chicago. In the late 1920s he began a series of marble figures that were exhibited at the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York.

As winner of the Prix de Rome in 1838, with Saint Peter Healing a Lame Man at the Gate of the Temple, Pils went to the Académie de France in Rome, then led by Ingres (q.v.), and stayed in Italy until 1844. Often in poor health, Pils nevertheless managed to travel around and study the artifacts from antiquity. But his works were generally harshly criticized until his return to France, where his first success came five years later with the patriotic Rouget de l'Isle Singing the Marseillaise at the Residence of the Mayor of Strasbourg (1849, Historical Museum, Strasbourg). Pils would often choose his subjects in order to treat the life of the poor and ordinary people, such as his Death of a Sister of Charity (Salon 1850-51, Musée d'Orsay, Paris). A favorite of the imperial regime, Pils followed the French army to Crimea in 1854-55 and recorded the military campaign of Napoleon III. His Battle of Alma, 20 December 1854 (1861, Musée du Château de Versailles) was highly praised, and in 1863 he left for Algeria to carry out a commission for the emperor. One year later Pils became professor at the École des Beaux-Arts, and he would receive several honors and awards. The artist was given commissions for decorations in the churches of Saint-Eustache (1854) and Sainte-Clotilde (1858) in Paris, and he painted murals at the Opéra (1865-75).

One of the most widely exhibited artists working in Cleveland, Gaertner showed at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1922–53), the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1924–52), the Art Institute of Chicago (1925–49), the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1943–48), and the National Academy of Design (1944–50).

In 1886 he enrolled at the Académie Julian, where he was taught by Tony Robert-Fleury (1837-1911) and Bouguereau (q.v.). The following year he was accepted into the École des Beaux-Arts and was briefly in the atelier of Gérôme (q.v.). At this time he also studied seventeenth-century Dutch painting and the works of Chardin (1699-1779). By 1889 Vuillard was persuaded by his friend painter and theorist Maurice Denis (1870-1943) to join the newly formed group of artists known as the Nabis. The Nabis based many of their ideas on synthetism, first developed by Gauguin (q.v.) and Émile Bernard (1868-1941), in which the artist was to work not from nature but from memory. Vuillard's initial synthetist works reveal a preoccupation with pattern and bright colors, denying the three-dimensionality of the object. By 1892, however, his colors were more subdued, reflecting his desire to mimic the unusual lighting effects that he had seen in symbolist theater. Vuillard's first major commissions date from this time, including nine panels for the dining room of Alexandre Natanson and four decorative panels for the library of Dr. Henri Vaquez. In 1898 Vuillard visited Venice and Florence, and the following year he and Bonnard (q.v.), a fellow member of the Nabis, made an excursion to London. Later they went to Milan and Venice and eventually to Spain. Vuillard also made trips to Brittany and Normandy. His first public commission came in 1912, when he was asked to paint panels for the foyer of the Comédie des Champs-Elysées in Paris. During that period he moved beyond the synthetism of the Nabis and returned to a more traditional perspective. At the same time he was accepting commissions for portraits. In 1936 he was chosen to paint a mural at the Palais des Nations in Geneva and was subsequently elected to the Institut de France.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1868', 'death_year': '1940'}, {'id': 67382, 'description': 'Edward Ancourt (French, 1841–1898?)', 'extent': 'printed by', 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'printer', 'biography': None, 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1841', 'death_year': None}, {'id': 291938, 'description': 'Ambroise Vollard (French, 1867–1939)', 'extent': 'published by', 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'publisher', 'biography': 'French art dealer and publisher, 1867-1939', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1867', 'death_year': '1939'}]\n",

After passing through a succession of stylistic periods, most notably the Blue (1901-1904) and Rose (1904-1906) Periods, he collaborated with Georges Braque (1882-1963) in 1908 to invent Cubism, a revolutionary method of restructuring pictorial space. Picasso remained active until his death in 1973. Although his art still appears radical, many of his works are over one hundred years old. Cubism, perhaps the most important development in 20th-century art, was invented around 1908 by Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) and Georges Braque (1882-1963). The most revolutionary aspect of the style was not its obvious emphasis on geometric form; rather, it was the introduction of a radically new approach to configuring pictorial space. Since the Renaissance, artists had used various methods to create the illusion of distant space receding behind the canvas surface. The Cubists rejected that idea and collapsed space by compressing foreground, middle ground, and background into a continuous web of overlapping, intersecting planes. During the 1910s, other painters and sculptors embraced or adapted Cubism to their own ends. This revolutionary approach inspired a host of related movements and continues to influence the visual language of artists, architects, and designers throughout the world.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1881', 'death_year': '1973'}]\n",

      "[{'id': 1568, 'description': 'Eugène Boudin (French, 1824–1898)', 'extent': None, 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'artist', 'biography': 'Eugène Boudin is traditionally presented in literature as a self-taught artist, independent of the Parisian art world whose works, painted out of doors in a sketchy, light-hued style, foreshadowed impressionism.1 Recent scholarship has tempered this interpretation of the artist, but it conserves his importance to contemporaneous artistic concerns of modernity, the notion of \"finish,\" the relationship between the French city and countryside, and the marketing of art works.2 Raised by parents who worked on steamers, Boudin grew up in Le Havre on the Normandy coast. At the age of twenty, he and an associate established their own framing and stationery shop where they regularly served artists. In 1847 Boudin went to Paris to study art and made contacts with artists such as Couture (q.v.), who helped him win a three-year study grant in 1850 from the municipal council of Le Havre, and Constant Troyon (1810-1865). But it was along the Normandy coast, not in Paris, where Boudin first met painters Ribot (q.v.) in 1851, Monet (q.v.) in 1858, and Courbet (q.v.) in 1859 and art critic Charles Baudelaire in 1859 and painted in a coarse realist style. Boudin spent each winter, roughly November to May, in Paris, working in his studio. He spent the summer season, lasting from two to five months, making pictures on the Normandy coast or in the Breton landscape. In 1860 he began to paint scenes of fashionable society at the beach resorts of Trouville (The Beach at Trouville, Minneapolis Institute of Arts) and Deauville. At first his work attracted little critical notice, but Baudelaire praised his pastels in a review of the 1859 Salon where Boudin made his debut.4 By 1869 Boudin and his art came to be identified with the Normandy coast.5 After 1870 Boudin increasingly turned away from beach resort subjects to focus on port and harbor views and fisherfolk scenes. In 1881 Boudin entered into a business relationship with the important Parisian art dealer Durand-Ruel, who provided him with a regular income for the rights to his entire production. When Durand-Ruel mounted a one-person exhibition of Boudin\\'s works in 1883, the artist enjoyed financial and critical triumph. Boudin sold his first picture to the French state in 1886 (A Squall, Musée de Morlaix) and his second two years later (The Russian Corvette in the Eure Reservoir, Musée d\\'Agen). In 1892 he was decorated with the Legion of Honor. Extremely productive until the end of his life, Boudin left more than four thousand paintings and seven thousand works on paper, some of which he or his family bequeathed to the French nation and art museums of Le Havre and Honfleur. The reputation that Boudin quietly established is nowhere better evidenced than in the fact that the retro-spective exhibition of his work (January 1898) was held at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where Boudin never set foot and which had fought, and failed, to privilege history painting over landscape and genre. <br>1. By 1883 art critic Gustave Geffroy had already pronounced that Boudin \"is, together with Corot and Jongkind, one of the immediate precursors of Impressionism. He shows us that impenetrable black does not exist and that air is transparent.\" Cited in trans. in Hamilton 1992, 42. <br>2. See John House, \"Boudin\\'s Modernity,\" in Hamilton 1992, 15-23. <br>3. Courbet first visited Le Havre in 1841, the year he moved to Paris from Ornans. He returned at the time of the 1858 Salon du Havre, to which he contributed, and again in 1859. He is reported to have bought some of Boudin\\'s paintings. In 1865 the two painters socialized together and painted side by side at Trouville. <br>4. The artist exhibited no pastels in the Salon, but Baudelaire might have seen them in the artist\\'s studio or elsewhere. 5.

However, Bellows’s first love, art, ultimately intervened, and after his junior year he relocated to New York to study painting. In a remarkably short period he became the leading artist of his generation, a reputation fueled through boxing subjects such as <em>Stag at Sharkey’s.</em> In his later years he developed recreational passions for tennis and billiards, which he routinely played with friends.

That summer he moved to New York and studied briefly at the Art Students League. The following year he returned to Cleveland to become an instructor at the Cleveland School of Art, a position he held until his death. He had first solo exhibition in 1911 at the studio he shared with Walter Heller. In 1913 Eastman befriended one of his students, Charles Burchfield, and the two became frequent sketching companions. Around 1915 Eastman began experimenting with gold- and silver-leaf grounds in paintings based on “principles of pure design.” He exhibited in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1919–50). On sabbatical from the art school in 1922, he studied at the Académie Julian in Paris and spent the following year painting in France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. In the summer of 1925 he returned to Europe to paint. He directed the Eastman-Bolton Gallery, 1926–38, a decorative-design firm that he cofounded. In the summer of 1930 Eastman went on another painting excursion to France, Italy, and Holland. In 1931 he was elected president of the Cleveland Society of Artists. The following year he organized the city’s first artist’s Curb Market to stimulate sales of local artists’ work. During the 1930s and 1940s his paintings appeared in solo exhibitions in Cleveland, Akron, Columbus, and the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Massachusetts. In the summer of 1939 he made the first of many painting trips to the American West and Mexico. On returning from one of these trips in 1950, Eastman died of a heart attack.

His work was first publicly exhibited in a 1924 group show at London's Redfern Gallery, and the following year he traveled through Europe on a scholarship from the Royal College of Art. Moore was given his first one-artist exhibition at London's Warren Gallery in 1928 and that same year received his first public commission (West Wind, a relief carving in stone for one of the facades of the city's new Underground Railway headquarters). By the early 1930s he had been named head of the new department of sculpture at the Chelsea School of Art in London, and in 1934 the first monograph devoted to his sculpture was published, Henry Moore: Sculpture.\\r\\n\\tDuring the early years of his career, Moore began photographing his sculptures, creating images that generally served as straightforward records of completed pieces or as documents of works in progress. Some were more dramatic, employing an unusual viewpoint or strong, raking light to emphasize a piece's particular texture: stone, wood, lead, or bronze. Moore often worked on his sculpture outdoors, and most of his photographs are set outside as well. Photography sometimes proved a useful tool in helping him decide how a work should be sited (the best height for viewing or its proximity to a grove of trees, for example).\\r\\n\\tOver the years, Moore produced hundreds of photographs, creating a personal document of his long career. A selection of these images was featured in Henry Moore's Photographs of His Sculpture, an exhibition organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1985).

Pursuing a career in commercial lithography, Sommer apprenticed at Calvert Lithography in Detroit, 1881–88, and subsequently worked at various lithography shops in Boston, New York, and England. In 1890 he went abroad for a year of study at the Kunstakademie in Munich. In 1891 he returned to New York and spent the next 16 years working as a commercial lithographer. In 1907 he moved to Cleveland to work for the Otis Lithograph Company, where he became friendly with William Zorach. Around 1910, and under the influence of Abel Warshawsky, Sommer began to experiment with impressionist colors; subsequently he experimented with a fauvist palette. He exhibited with the Cleveland “secessionists” at the Rorimer-Brooks Studios in early 1911 and cofounded the Kokoon Klub that summer. Around 1914 he moved to Brandywine, a rural valley about 20 miles south of Cleveland, where he converted an abandoned schoolhouse into a studio that became an important meeting place for modern artists, poets, and musicians. In May 1918 Sommer designed stage sets and programs for a production of <em>Everyman</em> by the Cleveland Play House. He exhibited in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1922–50). In the 1930s and 1940s he exhibited on a regular basis in Cleveland, Chicago, and New York. During the Depression he was employed by various New Deal art programs to paint murals for Cleveland Public Hall (1933), Cleveland Public Library (1934), the post office in Geneva, Ohio (1938), and the Akron Board of Education (1941). After the death of his wife in 1945, he was struck by chronic bouts of depression and alcoholism.

Encouraged by his family, he took private watercolor lessons and won art prizes in county and state fairs in his early teens. He studied with William Eastman, Henry Keller, and Paul Travis at the Cleveland School of Art, 1923–27. He exhibited in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1927–39). In 1927 William Milliken, then curator of paintings at the art museum, organized a subscription scholarship to allow Carter two years of travel through Italy, Switzerland, England, and France. In the summer of 1927 he studied in Capri with Hans Hofmann. On returning to Cleveland in 1929, Carter had his first solo exhibition at the Cleveland Art Center. He taught studio classes at the Cleveland Museum of Art, 1930–37. In 1934, under the auspices of the Public Works of Art Project, the first of the New Deal art programs, Carter was commissioned to paint two murals for Cleveland Public Auditorium. For a subsequent governmental art program, the Works Progress Administration, he served as a district supervisor for painting projects in north east Ohio. After 1935 he completed two federal mural commissions: one for the post office in Ravenna, Ohio, and another for the post office in his hometown. In 1938 he moved to Pittsburgh to teach at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie-Mellon University). During the 1930s and 1940s he showed in annual exhibitions in Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. <br><em>Transformations in Cleveland Art</em> (CMA, 1996), p. 224', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1904', 'death_year': '2000'}]\n",

He became interested in art during his teen years and studied with De Scott Evans and also learned from Willis Seaver Adams and Sion Wenban. In 1876 Bacher helped found the Art Club and had a solo show at the Kemmer and Kushman Decorating Company. The following year he had his second solo exhibition, at J. W. Sargeant’ s Art Shop. He traveled to Europe in 1878, attended the Munich Royal Academy, and studied with Cincinnati native Frank Duveneck in Munich, Florence, and Venice. A chance meeting in Venice with James A. McNeill Whistler in 1880 led to a long friendship that had a decisive effect on Bacher’ s etching style. In 1883 Bacher returned to Cleveland and began teaching at the Cleveland Academy of Art and privately at a summer retreat he organized in Richfield, Ohio. He returned to Europe in 1885, hoping to stay for an extended period, but his financial situation forced him to come back to America. After a brief visit to Cleveland, Bacher settled in New York City. To support himself, he did illustrations for <em>Century Magazine</em> in 1888.

Gottwald then traveled to Munich and attended the Kunstakademie, 1882–85. Returning to Cleveland, he began teaching at the Western Reserve School of Design for Women and remained on the facility until retiring in 1926. He frequently participated in local group exhibitions at the Art Club, the Brush and Palette Club, the Cleveland School of Art, and the Cleveland Museum of Art. He also showed at the Boston Art Club and the National Academy of Design in New York. Around the turn of the century, he made several summer painting trips to Holland. Beginning in 1903, the Cleveland School of Art mounted the first of many solo exhibitions of his paintings. From 1907 to 1915 he produced a series of landscapes created during annual summer excursions to Italy. He exhibited these works, which yielded his greatest critical and popular acclaim, on a regular basis at the Cleveland School of Art. He was instrumental in founding the Cleveland Society of Artists in 1913. During the 1920s he painted in Italy, Southern France, Spain, and North Africa. His last exhibition was held in Cleveland (1931).

In addition to the realistic Hungarian landscapes he painted, the artist supported himself with portraits and miniatures on porcelain. From 1830 until 1832, he worked in Kismarton. The Viennese banker Geymüller was instrumental in making possible Markó's move to Rome in 1832. There he started painting idyllic landscapes with mythological or biblical subjects and peasant scenes. In 1838 he moved to Pisa and two years later left for Florence to teach at the academy. From 1847 on he lived in Count Gherardesca's Villa Appeggi near Florence, where, for example, he painted the Cleveland painting. In 1853 Markó visited Vienna and received a warm welcome in Budapest. Even while living in Italy, Markó stayed in touch with the artistic community in Hungary and was an important figure in the development of Hungarian painting. He regularly sent paintings to exhibitions there, had Hungarian pupils in Italy, and, in 1845, submitted a design for the new parliament building in Budapest. During his lifetime, he was well known. In 1861 most of his estate went to the National Museum in Budapest.

The son of a prosperous miller and gentleman farmer, he entered into his profession late and was basically self-taught. Between 1796 and 1799 Constable had the advice of several artists and connoisseurs influential in the London art scene, primarily that of Sir George Beaumont (1753-1827), John Thomas Smith (1766-1833), and Joseph Farington (1747-1821). With the grudging consent of his parents, he entered the Royal Academy schools in 1799, the same year Turner was elected an associate member. (Twenty years would elapse before the academy conceded Constable that gesture of recognition.) He emerged publicly as a mature and focused painter of naturalistic landscapes in 1802 with the exhibition of his first oil painting at the Royal Academy.1 Shortly afterward he moved to his family home in East Bergholt with the intention of getting \"a pure and unaffected representation of the scenes that may employ me.\" The tours of 1806 produced an important body of Lake District material, especially studies in watercolor and in graphite, a medium Constable employed with unrivaled ability even at this early date. In 1808 he began a period of intense plein-air oil sketching and by 1814 was painting finished pictures like the magnificent Stour Valley and Dedham Village (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) or Wivenhoe Park, Essex (National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.)2 entirely out of doors. The Stour River, Flatford Mill, and Dedham Vale were the subjects to which he returned repeatedly with brilliant success. With his bride, Maria Bicknell, the artist moved permanently to London in 1816. His repertoire of subjects would expand to include Brighton, Salisbury, and Hampstead Heath, and both his practice and his fortunes also evolved in a significant new direction when he began his six-foot pictures of Suffolk landscape painted in the London studio. The scale of such works as The White Horse (1819, Frick Collection, New York)3 undoubtedly contributed to his successful bid for associate membership in the Royal Academy that year. With Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830) and Bonington (q.v.), Constable created a sensation at the 1824 Paris Salon, where he exhibited The Hay Wain (National Gallery, London) and View on the Stour near Dedham (Huntington Art Gallery, San Marino),4 although French artists had known and admired his work since 1820. After the death of his wife in 1828 and his election as full academician in 1829, Constable turned toward consolidating his reputation through writing, lecturing, and the medium of printmaking. He published English Landscape (1830-32) in collaboration with the mezzotint engraver David Lucas, but it was commercially unsuccessful. He never ceased to work from nature, but the later masterworks Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows (1831, National Gallery, London), The Opening of Waterloo Bridge (1832, Tate Gallery, London), and Arundel Mill and Castle (1837, Toledo Museum of Art)5 are pictures in which an expressionistic use of the medium struggles against an ever-increasing imaginative formalization of natural motifs.\\r\\n1.

Gretchen,1 he went to Paris in 1845, working assiduously by entering the studio of François-Édouard Picot (1786-1868), copying Old Masters in the Louvre, and taking classes at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1847 he returned to Amsterdam, and his Ophelia (1850, Dordrechts Museum), much indebted to Scheffer, established his reputation. In 1853 Israëls returned to Paris, finally met Scheffer, and visited Barbizon. Two years later, suffering from bad health, Israëls spent seven weeks in the coastal village of Zandvoort living in a carpenter\\'s cabin. The life of the poor fishing community with which he became so familiar developed into the major theme in his art. The success of his Passing Mother\\'s Grave (1856, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam), a large work addressing the fateful life of a fisherman widower and his two children, encouraged the artist to abandon history painting. After a tremendously successful showing of Fishermen Carrying a Drowned Man (1861, National Gallery, London) at the 1861 Paris Salon and the 1862 London International Exhibition, his reputation was firmly established abroad. With the grandiose treatment that he applied to these works, Israëls introduced into Dutch art a realist style in emulation of Courbet (q.v.). In 1863 he married Aleida Schaap, with whom he had a daughter, Mathilde Anna, and a son, Isaac, who would also become an established painter. In The Hague, where he moved in 1871, he eventually built a large studio where his models posed in his \"fisherman\\'s corner.\" Israëls was one of the leading members of De Haagse School (The Hague School), which included such artists as Johannes Bosboom (1817-1891), Jacob (1837-1899) and Matthijs (1839-1917) Maris, Anton Mauve (1838-1888), Hendrik Willem Mesdag (1831-1915), and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch (1824-1903). In addition to fishermen scenes and portraits, he expanded his subject matter with peasant scenes, and later in his career he returned to the subject of death and old age, as well as treating Jewish and biblical themes. He traveled extensively and was much honored at home and abroad. Israëls was the most acclaimed Dutch painter in his time, eagerly sought after by collectors in Great Britain, the United States, and other countries. Hailed as a second Rembrandt, he participated in many exhibitions, and his work was disseminated through reproductions. In 1910 he was honored with an exhibition at the Venice Biennale. He died one year later in Scheveningen and received a state funeral. 1. It might be the version in a private collection in Paris; see Leo Ewals, Ary Scheffer 1795-1858.

      "[{'id': 1658, 'description': 'Eugène Delacroix (French, 1798–1863)', 'extent': None, 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'artist', 'biography': 'Eugène Delacroix studied under history painter Pierre-Narcisse Guérin (1774-1833) and at the École des Beaux-Arts, though he did not succeed in competitions there. He soon befriended romantic painter Théodore Géricault (1791-1824) and exhibited at his first Salon in 1822 his powerful, moody The Barque of Dante (Musée du Louvre, Paris). In the next Salon, inspired by the recent events in the Greeks\\' struggle for independence against the Turks, Delacroix showed Scenes from the Massacres at Chios (Musée du Louvre, Paris), a painting whose anti-academic composition, free brushwork, and brilliant color caused hostile critics to accuse the artist of the \"massacre of painting.\" Nevertheless, he was awarded a Salon medal and the state purchased the picture. \\r\\nAfter the early death of Géricault, the young artist became the titular head of the French romantic artistic movement, as much for his innovative technique as his new themes. Widely read and an Anglophile, Delacroix drew frequently from British literature, especially Shakespeare, Byron, and Sir Walter Scott. He also developed a strong interest in orientalist subjects, spurred by the five-month trip to Morocco and southern Spain he took in 1832. He stressed the creative and imaginative elements of painting and opposed the academy for its rote learning and the bourgeoisie for its overly materialistic interests. Delacroix discussed his aesthetic ideas with an ever-expanding circle of writers, musicians, and artists that he frequented, including pianist-composer Frédéric Chopin and writer George Sand. But ultimately he developed a personal conception of beauty that could only be expressed in an individualized manner. \\r\\nRecent studies have revised the long-standing interpretation of Delacroix as a radical, anticlassical, misunderstood, and unsupported genius. He greatly admired antiquity and the classical authors but insisted on avoiding the narrow or didactic view of them offered by the academies. He may not have emulated classical statuary as sources for his figures, but he did often represent heroic nude figures. For all his insistence on invention, Delacroix retained some sense of documentary reconstruction, for he made numerous studies of costumes and weapons and did other kinds of research before tackling certain subjects. From the beginning and throughout his career, Delacroix received many religious and historical painting commissions, from provincial churches to government buildings, under different rulers and even political systems. His allegorical work Liberty Leading the Barricades (1830-31, Musée du Louvre, Paris) represents the only painting in which the artist referred to a contemporary political event in France, the revolution that overthrew Louis XVIII and the Bourbon monarchy. This, too, was purchased by the state. In 1833 he was asked to decorate with allegories the Salon du Roi of the Palais Bourbon, the seat of the deputies. Their success brought him additional commissions in the same building, such as the library (1838), and then the library in the senate (1841-46), housed in the Palais du Luxembourg. His historical, religious, and allegorical paintings were often criticized by more conservative critics for a lack of decorum, anatomical distortions, too-bright or unnaturalistic color, and free brushwork, but he continued to find work because he was one of the few artists who continued to explore these \"elevated\" genres and had a sure sense of the decorative. \\r\\nExtremely prolific, Delacroix accomplished a major mural commission for the church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris (1850-63) the year before his death. He was even elected in 1857 to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, but younger artists consistently regarded him as antiestablishment and a paragon of artistic experimentation. He wrote extensively on art and aesthetic issues, both in his private diaries and for published journals.1\\r\\n1. Recently, scholars such as Michele Hannoosh, Painting and the Journal of Eugene Delacroix (Princeton, 1995), have examined the content and style of Delacroix\\'s texts for what they might tell about Delacroix the writer as well as the work and creative process of Delacroix the artist.\\r\\nDelacroix was one of the most innovative and successful painters of the first half of the 19th century. He is known as the last great history painter and his art is the ideal of Romanticism in the visual arts. Delacroix\\'s career is marked by the paradox between the revolutionary and the conventional. He was in conflict with the artist Ingres and was seen as the leading figure of the French Romantic movement; he was famed for undermining the tradition of painting established by David, yet he benefited from official patronage from the beginning of the Restoration (1814-1830) until the Second Empire (1852-1870).', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1798', 'death_year': '1863'}]\n",

Van Marcke's first animal studies were made at the imperial farms at Villeneuve-l'Étang and in Grignon, where he was a frequent visitor. He then spent time in Brittany, the Landes, and Sologne, finally settling in Bouttencourt in Normandy. He almost exclusively painted animals, but he also produced some landscapes and beach scenes. Although he first began exhibiting at the Salon of 1857, it was only after the death of Troyon in 1865 that van Marcke began to attract attention in his chosen genre. Highly valued by English and American collectors, his work sold readily in these countries, where he began exhibiting in 1878.

As an adolescent, Turner colored engravings for the print sellers and apprenticed with architectural draftsman Thomas Malton (1726-1801). Although he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1789, Turner\\'s substantive artistic training came from his numerous self-conducted topographical drawing tours of the British Isles in the early 1790s and from his camaraderie with Thomas Girtin (1775-1802), with whom he copied the masterworks of landscape watercolorist John Robert Cozens (1752-1799) in the collection of Dr. Thomas Monro (1759-1833). Turner submitted his first oil painting, a seascape, for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1796 and was elected an associate member three years later, at the earliest permissible age. Devoted to the academy\\'s lofty mission, as it had been articulated by the recently deceased Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) in his annual lectures to the students of the academy, Turner would relish his election as a full academician in 1802 and would serve as professor of perspective from 1807 until 1837. His masterpieces of the early decades (and there seems an endless succession of works with title to that distinction) were either homages to past masters of landscape painting or entirely personal interpretations of the most extraordinary range of naturalistic effects and subjects. Whether it was The Fifth Plague of Egypt (1800, Indianapolis Museum of Art) and its amalgam of allusions to Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Richard Wilson (1714-1782), The Dort Packet-Boat from Rotterdam Becalmed (1818, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), with its overt tribute to Aelbert Cuyp (1620-1691), or The Fall of an Avalanche in the Grisons (1810, Tate Gallery, London), with its unprecedented invention of horrific naturalistic detail that challenged conventional notions of the sublime in art, the net effect of Turner\\'s achievement was to elevate landscape painting to a status within the traditional hierarchy of genres that it had rarely enjoyed since the seventeenth century. Unlike Constable (q.v.), Turner was an indefatigable traveler abroad. His first visit to Switzerland in 1802 resulted in a spectacular series of exhibition watercolors that boldly established watercolor painting as a vital medium of original expression. A tour of Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Rhine in 1817 was followed by his first protracted stay in Italy in 1819. After 1820 summer excursions to France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and especially Venice were almost annual occurrences. Gradually, and primarily after the 1819 Italian sojourn, Turner\\'s palette lightened. Traditional notions of chiaroscuro, of alternating bands of light and dark earth colors, yielded to compositions orchestrated in brighter hues, in which the various colors move across the painted surface almost at will, little respecting the forms they describe but in perfect balance.\\r\\nDuring the 1820s and early 1830s Turner committed vast amounts of his creative capital to the production of literary and travel illustrations. These kept an entire generation of engravers employed for several decades. Despite the tendency of his era to stigmatize reproductive engraving as an inferior instrument of artistic presentation, Turner was preoccupied with its processes and potential, acutely aware that, long after his pigments had faded, his reputation would be secure in the more durable brilliance of the engraver\\'s deftly crafted reproductions. A second trip to Italy in 1828 may partially account for the heightened coloring of Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus (1828, National Gallery, London), which John Ruskin described as a pivotal picture in Turner\\'s career. But there was very little falling off in either technical or thematic invention during the last decades of Turner\\'s life. In major oils like Snow Storm-Steam Boat Off a Harbor\\'s Mouth (1842, Tate Gallery, London) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844, National Gallery, London) and no less measure in the series of elaborately finished Swiss watercolors executed on commission at the end of his life, natural forms occupy an uncertain place between concrete reality and total dissolution by light into the colors and images of what Monet (q.v.) admiringly called the \"exuberant romanticism of Turner\\'s fancy.\" Perspective can be intentionally distorted and the color schemes can approach the brazenly artificial, yet somehow the fundamental truth of Turner\\'s vision, his faith in the supreme forces of nature and in the artist\\'s preeminence as the mediator of that experience, continues to persuade.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1775', 'death_year': '1851'}]\n",

In 1850 he left Grenoble and moved to Paris to study under Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897), an innovative and nontraditional instructor who developed and published his own unique teaching method based on painting and drawing from memory. Fantin studied with him for six years and then attended the École des Beaux-Arts for less than a year in 1854. Encouraged by J. A. M. Whistler (1834-1903), whom he met in 1858 at the Louvre, Fantin-Latour made several trips to London from 1859 to 1881, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy. London collectors appreciated his still lifes, and he began accepting numerous portrait commissions from English patrons. It was in London, through Whistler\\'s brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910), that Fantin first learned to etch. After his first Salon submissions were rejected in 1859, Fantin, in an effort to become better known in France, began exhibiting with his friend Manet (q.v.) and future impressionists Renoir (q.v.) and Monet (q.v.). In 1865 Fantin wrote collector Edwin Edwards: \"We form a group and make noise because there are lots of painters about and one is easily overlooked. When we get together . . . we gain strength in numbers and grow more adventurous. I thought it could last. That was my mistake.\" Unlike the realists and the impressionists, Fantin did not paint out of doors; rather, he preferred literary subjects, still lifes, and portraits that could be painted in his studio. In addition to portraits and still lifes, he made numerous paintings and more than 150 prints that were fantasy works and dream visions, paving the way for symbolist artists. These works were inspired by allegorical and mythological subjects as well as motivated by contemporary German composers such as Schumann and Wagner. After Fantin\\'s death in 1904, critic René-Marc Ferry wrote: \"when he found realism too limited and stifling, he lost himself in dreams, but his dreams went no further than the windows of his studio.

In 1855 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts and became a student of Louis Lamothe (1822-1869), a former pupil of Ingres (q.v.). One year later Degas made the traditional journey to Italy, remaining there for three years. He visited family members in Naples and Florence and attended life classes at the Villa Medici in Rome. A visit to Normandy in 1861 may have introduced him to the racetrack. In Paris he continued to study at the Louvre, where he met Manet (q.v.) in 1862. Apart from his continuous interest in portraiture and history painting, Degas began to pay attention to subjects of modern life. Between 1865 and 1870, he exhibited at the Salon. At the time of the Franco-Prussian War, he enlisted in the artillery, but because of his poor eyesight he served (with Manet) in the infantry. After the war he traveled first to London and, in 1872-73, visited his uncle and brothers who had a cotton business in New Orleans. Degas participated in the first impressionist exhibition of 1874. He continued to exhibit with these artists until 1886 but never completely considered himself a member of the group, preferring to call himself a realist or naturalist. While many of the impressionists painted en plein air, Degas worked with models in his studio and, later in his career, from his imagination. In addition to painting, he experimented often with monotypes, engraving, pastels, sculpture, and photography. He traveled extensively-London, Naples, Spain, Morocco, and Switzerland-but continued to draw his subject matter from modern-day Paris. Other recurring themes would be the female nude and the ballet dancer. After the impressionist exhibition of 1886, Degas no longer participated in group shows. Instead he sold his works to private dealers such as Durand-Ruel and Ambroise Vollard. In the 1890s he began his own art collection, which, besides many works on paper, included paintings by such artists as Ingres, Cézanne (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), and van Gogh (q.v.). His own art at the time became characterized by broader strokes of paint, charcoal, and pastel and the use of more vibrant colors, partly because of problems with his vision.

By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Académie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Frédéric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (Déjeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to Fécamp, then Étretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouillère on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the Hôtel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to Vétheuil with the Hoschedés, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hoschedé spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hoschedé died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908.

For these writers his importance lay in his loosely painted, atmospheric landscapes, for which later modernists called him the precursor to impressionism. This conception of the artist has undergone significant revision with recent scholarship. Corot never seemed to accept the impressionists' more radical work, especially their enthusiasm for contemporary urban and suburban themes. He represented timeless, rural views disconnected from the industrialization and modernization of nineteenth-century France.\\r\\nFollowing his father in the clothing trade, Corot worked for eight years before the death of his younger sister in 1821 provided him with the additional income (her annual allowance) to enable him to devote himself to painting. In 1822 he began to study with the landscape painter Achille-Etna Michallon (1796-1822), winner of the first Grand Prix de Rome in historicized landscape, and after Michallon's early death that year, with Bertin (q.v.). Both Michallon and Bertin had trained with Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (1750-1819), whose later eighteenth-century treatise on landscape painting practice urged artists to study nature closely. In addition, Michallon frequented the village of Barbizon and the forest of Fontainebleau, which would become important subjects for Corot and the group of painters known as the Barbizon school.\\r\\nIn 1825 Corot made his first trip to Italy, following in the tradition of the French academy but also the independent precedent of the seventeenth-century French painter Claude Lorrain. There Corot joined an international circle of artists, including Léopold Robert (1794-1835) and Aligny (q.v.), who struggled to resolve the contradictory phases of empirical study out of doors and synthetic recreation in the studio. From Rome, he sent his first submissions to the Paris Salon in 1827, among them The View at Narni (National Gallery of Canada, Ottowa). These early Italian views generally feature a bright, warm light with few areas in shadow.\\r\\nCorot gradually shifted from this early style to one in the 1840s that frequently included larger figures in the middle ground, more complex light effects, and a duller, earthy palette of greens and browns. He continued to use his outdoor works as models for finished canvases but freely adapted the compositions, forms, lighting, and color. The question of finish did not only pertain to the relationship between plein-air studies and studio compositions, which he called paysage composé (invented landscape). Corot sometimes added figures to landscapes that he had painted years earlier and even asked fellow painters such as Diaz de la Peña (q.v.) to paint them. His titles often referred to the geographical location that inspired the image, and some included the word souvenir (broad-ly translated as memory), which suggests recreating or revisiting some experience. \\r\\nThe critical reception of Corot's work fluctuated. His first Salon submissions passed the jury, but during the 1830s he was first overlooked and then attacked by the critics. By the 1840s his fortunes had improved, and he even sold one Salon picture to the French state. In more radical circles, the critic-poet Charles Baudelaire held Corot up as a leader in contemporary landscape painting. Corot received the Legion of Honor in 1846 as well as a municipal commission to decorate the baptismal fonts in the church of St. Nicolas du Chardonnet in Paris. \\r\\nIn the early 1850s Corot transformed his style again. He developed silvery tones and diffuse lighting effects applied in a few thin layers, over which he added small touches of brighter color for highlights. The soft glimmer and evocative atmosphere of these later works earned him commercial and critical success. During the last decade, Corot turned toward the single figure as subject. The meditative poses and expressions of these figures reminded some contemporary critics of seventeenth-century painting, especially the realism of Spanish and Dutch pictures. But Corot's landscapes remained his most admired work, and during his lifetime imitations or fakes were sold under his name.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1796', 'death_year': '1875'}]\n",

Daubigny's uncle, Pierre, and his uncle's wife were also painters. In order to finance a trip to Italy, Daubigny began painting decorative panels for the Musée de Versailles. By 1835 he had earned enough money for the excursion and, accompanied by Henri Mignon, traveled through Rome, Florence, Pisa, and Genoa, studying the Italian country-side. Upon his return to Paris in 1836 Daubigny began working for Granet (q.v.) in the paintings restoration depart-ment of the Louvre. He made his Salon debut two years later and would regularly show there until 1868. During this time he also learned etching, and it became a good source of income while still allowing him time to paint. Daubigny began to travel often, to Normandy in 1842, to the forest of Fontainebleau and on to Burgundy in 1843. He became friends with Corot (q.v.), and the two artists painted together in Switzerland and the Dauphiné. In 1857 Daubigny bought a boat that he converted into a studio and used to explore the Oise, Marne, and Seine rivers. The boat allowed him freedom to choose the best viewpoints for his landscapes, an idea that Monet (q.v.) would adopt years later. Daubigny achieved some financial success, received the Legion of Honor in 1859, and a year later built a home and studio in Auvers. In 1861, however, he was criticized because his works were becoming darker and sketchier. He was, in fact, one of the earliest artists to become interested in capturing the changing quality of nature by using light, rapid brush strokes.\\r\\nWhile experimenting with painting, Daubigny continued his interest in printmaking. In 1862 he participated in an exhibit funded by Cadart, a print publisher and dealer. The exhibition concerned artists who considered printmaking a legitimate art in itself, not a medium for simple reproduction. Cadart became Daubigny's exclusive publisher. Along with Corot, Daubigny also experimented with the cliché verre technique. He continued to travel, in Brittany in 1867 and Spain in 1868-69. He was also supportive of other artists. As a member of the Salon jury of 1868, he was instrumental in having the works of Degas (q.v.), Morisot (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), Renoir (q.v.), Sisley (q.v.), Monet, and Frédéric Bazille (1841-1870) accepted. Daubigny moved to London in 1870 to escape the Franco-Prussian War. There he introduced Pissarro and Monet to Paul Durand-Ruel, his art dealer, who had opened a gallery in London. Daubigny returned to Paris after the war, traveling around the French countryside until the end of his life.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1817', 'death_year': '1878'}]\n",
      "[{'id': 1768, 'description': 'Édouard Detaille (French, 1848–1912)', 'extent': None, 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'artist', 'biography': \"In 1865 Meissonier (q.v.) was asked to give a recommendation for Édouard Detaille, then seventeen years old, to apprentice with Alexandre Cabanel (1823-1889). After seeing Detaille's portfolio, however, Meissonier himself accepted him as a student. Detaille received a thorough training, and the same precision that defined the work of his teacher would soon characterize Detaille as an artist. He made his debut at the Salon as early as 1867 with the Interior of Meissonier's Studio, but his reputation was firmly established at the Salon of 1869, when he received his first medal for A Rest During Maneuvers, Camp at Saint Maur. The military predilection that dominated Detaille's oeuvre was undoubtedly influenced by the fact that his grandfather had been an arms supplier to Napoléon, his brother served in the military, and his father was close friends with the battle painter Vernet (q.v.). Before the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) erupted, Detaille was on a sketching trip in Algeria. He returned to France and joined the Eighth Battalion of the Mobiles and recorded enemy positions under General Appert. This firsthand experience of military life provided him with ample material for his subsequent artistic output. The Victors and A German Convoy, which Detaille submitted to the Salon of 1872, were rejected by officials in order to avoid diplomatic embarrassment with the German government, to whom France was paying a huge war indemnity. He studied and collected French and foreign uniforms and in 1883 issued two illustrated volumes recording the various uniforms of the French army from 1789 to 1870. Detaille also represented scenes of the Franco-Prussian War in two vast panoramas, Champigny and Rezonville (1882, 1883, now dispersed), on which he collaborated with another famous battle painter of the era, Alphonse Marie Deneuville (1835-1885). Even after the war, Detaille continued his involvement with military maneuvers, including, for example, an expedition to Tunisia in 1881. Apart from his easel paintings and panoramas, the artist also painted murals (1905, Panthéon, Paris; 1908, Hôtel de Ville, Paris) and made watercolors. He has been criticized by some for paying too much attention to details rather than the overall composition and for his overly nationalistic sympathies. However, Detaille should be regarded as the quasi-official French military painter of the second half of the nineteenth century. He received many honors, and in 1916 a gallery dedicated to his work opened in the Musée de l'Armée in Paris. At the end of his career, Detaille's artistic approach may have seemed outdated, but from a political point of view it certainly served its purpose.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1848', 'death_year': '1912'}]\n",

      "[{'id': 1594, 'description': 'Théodore Rousseau (French, 1812–1867)', 'extent': None, 'qualifier': 'imitator of', 'role': 'artist', 'biography': 'Introduced to landscape painting through his cousin Pau de Saint-Martin (q.v.), Rousseau entered the studio of Jean-Charles-Joseph Rémond (1795-1875) in 1826 and was later taught by history painter Guillaume Lethière (1760-1832). The young artist copied the works of Claude Lorrain (1600-1682) and Dutch seventeenth-century landscape painters at the Louvre, and he was intrigued by contemporary painters such as Constable (q.v.) and Bonington (q.v.). His foremost interest, however, was the study of nature. In 1830 he traveled extensively through the Auvergne and was much inspired by the wilderness of this region. Scheffer (q.v.), who admired Rousseau\\'s nature studies from this period, introduced him to the Paris art circles of Charles Baudelaire and Delacroix (q.v.). In the early 1830s Rousseau also met Corot (q.v.) and became very close friends with Dupré (q.v.). Rousseau exhibited at the Salons of 1831 and 1833-35. After 1836 he began to travel extensively throughout France, notably to the forest of Fontainebleau and to Barbizon, where he would return every year and become the leader of the group of romantic-naturalist artists, the so-called Barbizon School. In the 1850s he also became increasingly involved in the movement to preserve the forest of Fontainebleau from industrialization. From 1836 until 1841 all of Rousseau\\'s works were refused at the Salon because the jury advocated a more classicizing landscape painting. As he was also often passed over for official honors, the artist became known as \"le grand refusé\" and abstained from showing his work at the Salon most of the 1840s. After the 1848 revolution, the new regime under Napoleon III rated his work more favorably, even granting him a first-class medal at the 1849 Salon, so he no longer had to submit his work to the jury. Yet Rousseau had not been awarded the Legion of Honor, an even stronger insult when Dupré received it. In the early 1850s Rousseau befriended Millet (q.v.), and the two often worked together in Barbizon. Rousseau\\'s international breakthrough occurred at the 1855 Exposition Universelle, where his work was exhibited in a gallery that he shared with Decamps (q.v.). Throughout his career, however, the sale of his work was unstable, partly because not showing regularly at the Salon limited his exposure. The artist therefore even had to organize two auctions (1850, 1861) of his works in order to make money, but the results were disappointing. Rousseau exhibited thirteen paintings at the Exposition Universelle of 1867 and figured as president of the jury. Yet because of his animosity with Comte de Nieuwerkerke, directeur-général des musées impériaux, the artist only received a grand medal and not the anticipated highest rank, Officer of the Legion of Honor. The lesser medal was awarded only after heavy protest from Rousseau\\'s friends, five months before his death, and Nieuwerkerke had the last word, refusing to honor the artist with a posthumous retrospective as would have been expected. Although Barbizon painters such as Rousseau are noted for their study from nature, many worked on their larger canvases in the studio. And even though his art was still rooted in a romantic spirit, Rousseau\\'s plein-air studies and his preoccupation with the rendering of specific light effects were instrumental for the development of impressionism.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1812', 'death_year': '1867'}]\n",

Monticelli moved to Paris in 1846 and entered the École des Beaux-Arts under Delaroche (q.v.). He spent his free time in the Louvre copying works by such painters as Veronese (1528-1588), Rubens (1577-1640), Rembrandt (1606-1669), Watteau (1684-1721), Fragonard (1732-1806), and Delacroix (q.v.). In the following years he would divide his time between Marseilles and Paris. He traveled throughout Provence with Guigou (q.v.), and together they painted the surrounding landscapes and villages. In Paris in 1856 he met Diaz de la Peña (q.v.), who encouraged him to use bolder colors and a heavier texture. Under the influence of Diaz, he also began adding small figures in his landscapes. That same year Monticelli returned to Marseilles, where he would remain for seven years. He again made landscape studies while earning money with his portraits. When he moved back to Paris in 1863, he specialized in depicting the fashionable society in lush landscapes, recalling the works of Watteau. He enjoyed some popularity within these circles because of the revival of interest in the rococo style. He also encountered some impressionist painters. He returned to Marseilles when the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) broke out and remained there for the rest of his life, creating his most mature works. He painted with Cézanne (q.v.) in the areas around Aix and Marseilles. In his late landscapes he experimented with paint texture, using thick impasto on a bare canvas to create a dynamic surface. These experiments were to leave a strong impression on van Gogh (q.v.), who saw them at the Galerie Delarebeyrette in Paris in 1886, the year of Monticelli's death. Around that time, Monticelli already had several emulators copying his work, which explains the abundant production of fake Monticellis that have since invaded the art market.\", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1824', 'death_year': '1886'}]\n",

He became interested in art during a trip to Italy in 1846, and the following year he began studying with Henri Scheffer (1798-1862). Puvis returned to Italy in 1848 with Louis Bauderon de Vermeron (1809-1870), where he became interested in the art of mural painting. He entered the atelier of Delacroix (q.v.) for only two weeks, and later that of Couture (q.v.) for three months. Yet, Puvis's chief method of study was to work independently after live models. He was accepted in the Salon of 1850, but his submissions from 1852 through 1859 were rejected. In 1854-55 he decorated the dining room at his brother's country house, Le Brouchy, near Cuiseaux. He won a second-class medal at the Salon of 1861 for Concordia (Musée de Picardie, Amiens), which was purchased by the state. Inspired by the frescoes of Pompeii and by Piero della Francesca's Legend of the True Cross in Arezzo, Puvis pursued his interest in mural painting with great success. He received commissions to create works for the Palais des Arts in Lyons, the Pantheon and the Hôtel de Ville in Paris, the Boston Public Library, and many others. The artist strove to integrate his mural paintings with the surrounding architecture and to maintain the integrity of the flat wall surface by using broad areas of subdued color. In 1890, together with Meissonier (q.v.) and Rodin (1840-1917), Puvis founded the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, as a more progressive alternative for the regular Salon.

Boucher's sketchy manner of painting helped to promote painterliness as an end in itself.

In 1890 he went to Karlsruhe, Germany, for a year of study with Hermann Baisch. Unable to find a teaching position after returning to Cleveland, Keller worked for eight years at the Morgan Lithograph Company, where he specialized in designing circus posters. In 1899 he returned to Germany to study at art academies in Düsseldorf and Munich. In 1902, after receiving a silver medal at the Munich Kunstakademie’ s spring exhibition, he returned to Cleveland. Around 1903 he began teaching at the Cleveland School of Art, first as a part-time watercolor instructor, then as full-time instructor of decorative illustration. He also taught private classes on family-owned farmland in Berlin Heights, Ohio, during summers from 1903 to 1914. In the 1910s he championed the cause of modern art through lectures and teaching. He exhibited in the Armory Show (1913) and the annuals of the Carnegie Institute of Art in Pittsburgh. The Cleveland School of Art sponsored several solo exhibitions of his paintings. He exhibited in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1919–50) and in annuals at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. When he retired from the Cleveland School of Art in 1945, Keller moved to San Diego, where he died.<br><em>Transformations in Cleveland Art.</em> (CMA, 1996), p. 232', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1869', 'death_year': '1949'}]\n",

His surviving works on panel include 26 triptychs, polyptychs, fragmentary panels, as well as a crucifix and a processional banner. His two major fresco cycles are in the Chapter House, the so-called Spanish Chapel, of Santa Maria Novella of Florence (c. 1365) and in the Camposanto of Pisa (1376/77-79). The Spanish Chapel frescoes are generally believed to glorify the Dominican Order, although the cycle's specific iconography is contested. His Camposanto frescoes depict scenes from the legend of Saint Raynerius (Raniero), the patron saint of Pisa. This project was unfinished at the time of Andrea's death, shortly after May 16, 1379, and was completed by Barnaba da Modena. Andrea was also engaged in manuscript illumination, as evidenced by the attribution of at least one miniature to him.  In addition, the design for the stained-glass rose window of the façade of Santa Maria Novella has been assigned to him.  In 1366-67, he served on an advisory board of artists on the construction of the new Duomo in Florence. He is believed to have had a prolific workshop with several assistants. Although Andrea is often considered a minor artist in late-trecento Florence, his significant fresco commissions and his participation in the Duomo project indicate that he was likely a highly respected master. Noted influences on his early manner include Bernardo Daddi, the brothers Andrea and Nardo di Cione, Maso di Banco, and Taddeo Gaddi. The influence of Andrea's mature style on subsequent painters has been cited in the work of a number of artists of the last quarter of the fourteenth century, including Agnolo Gaddi, the Master of the Straus Madonna, Lorenzo Monaco, and Niccolò di Tommaso.\\r\\n1.

As an adolescent, Turner colored engravings for the print sellers and apprenticed with architectural draftsman Thomas Malton (1726-1801). Although he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1789, Turner\\'s substantive artistic training came from his numerous self-conducted topographical drawing tours of the British Isles in the early 1790s and from his camaraderie with Thomas Girtin (1775-1802), with whom he copied the masterworks of landscape watercolorist John Robert Cozens (1752-1799) in the collection of Dr. Thomas Monro (1759-1833). Turner submitted his first oil painting, a seascape, for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1796 and was elected an associate member three years later, at the earliest permissible age. Devoted to the academy\\'s lofty mission, as it had been articulated by the recently deceased Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) in his annual lectures to the students of the academy, Turner would relish his election as a full academician in 1802 and would serve as professor of perspective from 1807 until 1837. His masterpieces of the early decades (and there seems an endless succession of works with title to that distinction) were either homages to past masters of landscape painting or entirely personal interpretations of the most extraordinary range of naturalistic effects and subjects. Whether it was The Fifth Plague of Egypt (1800, Indianapolis Museum of Art) and its amalgam of allusions to Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Richard Wilson (1714-1782), The Dort Packet-Boat from Rotterdam Becalmed (1818, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), with its overt tribute to Aelbert Cuyp (1620-1691), or The Fall of an Avalanche in the Grisons (1810, Tate Gallery, London), with its unprecedented invention of horrific naturalistic detail that challenged conventional notions of the sublime in art, the net effect of Turner\\'s achievement was to elevate landscape painting to a status within the traditional hierarchy of genres that it had rarely enjoyed since the seventeenth century. Unlike Constable (q.v.), Turner was an indefatigable traveler abroad. His first visit to Switzerland in 1802 resulted in a spectacular series of exhibition watercolors that boldly established watercolor painting as a vital medium of original expression. A tour of Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Rhine in 1817 was followed by his first protracted stay in Italy in 1819. After 1820 summer excursions to France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and especially Venice were almost annual occurrences. Gradually, and primarily after the 1819 Italian sojourn, Turner\\'s palette lightened. Traditional notions of chiaroscuro, of alternating bands of light and dark earth colors, yielded to compositions orchestrated in brighter hues, in which the various colors move across the painted surface almost at will, little respecting the forms they describe but in perfect balance.\\r\\nDuring the 1820s and early 1830s Turner committed vast amounts of his creative capital to the production of literary and travel illustrations. These kept an entire generation of engravers employed for several decades. Despite the tendency of his era to stigmatize reproductive engraving as an inferior instrument of artistic presentation, Turner was preoccupied with its processes and potential, acutely aware that, long after his pigments had faded, his reputation would be secure in the more durable brilliance of the engraver\\'s deftly crafted reproductions. A second trip to Italy in 1828 may partially account for the heightened coloring of Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus (1828, National Gallery, London), which John Ruskin described as a pivotal picture in Turner\\'s career. But there was very little falling off in either technical or thematic invention during the last decades of Turner\\'s life. In major oils like Snow Storm-Steam Boat Off a Harbor\\'s Mouth (1842, Tate Gallery, London) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844, National Gallery, London) and no less measure in the series of elaborately finished Swiss watercolors executed on commission at the end of his life, natural forms occupy an uncertain place between concrete reality and total dissolution by light into the colors and images of what Monet (q.v.) admiringly called the \"exuberant romanticism of Turner\\'s fancy.\" Perspective can be intentionally distorted and the color schemes can approach the brazenly artificial, yet somehow the fundamental truth of Turner\\'s vision, his faith in the supreme forces of nature and in the artist\\'s preeminence as the mediator of that experience, continues to persuade.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1775', 'death_year': '1851'}]\n",

Although he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1789, Turner\\'s substantive artistic training came from his numerous self-conducted topographical drawing tours of the British Isles in the early 1790s and from his camaraderie with Thomas Girtin (1775-1802), with whom he copied the masterworks of landscape watercolorist John Robert Cozens (1752-1799) in the collection of Dr. Thomas Monro (1759-1833). Turner submitted his first oil painting, a seascape, for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1796 and was elected an associate member three years later, at the earliest permissible age. Devoted to the academy\\'s lofty mission, as it had been articulated by the recently deceased Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) in his annual lectures to the students of the academy, Turner would relish his election as a full academician in 1802 and would serve as professor of perspective from 1807 until 1837. His masterpieces of the early decades (and there seems an endless succession of works with title to that distinction) were either homages to past masters of landscape painting or entirely personal interpretations of the most extraordinary range of naturalistic effects and subjects. Whether it was The Fifth Plague of Egypt (1800, Indianapolis Museum of Art) and its amalgam of allusions to Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Richard Wilson (1714-1782), The Dort Packet-Boat from Rotterdam Becalmed (1818, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), with its overt tribute to Aelbert Cuyp (1620-1691), or The Fall of an Avalanche in the Grisons (1810, Tate Gallery, London), with its unprecedented invention of horrific naturalistic detail that challenged conventional notions of the sublime in art, the net effect of Turner\\'s achievement was to elevate landscape painting to a status within the traditional hierarchy of genres that it had rarely enjoyed since the seventeenth century. Unlike Constable (q.v.), Turner was an indefatigable traveler abroad. His first visit to Switzerland in 1802 resulted in a spectacular series of exhibition watercolors that boldly established watercolor painting as a vital medium of original expression. A tour of Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Rhine in 1817 was followed by his first protracted stay in Italy in 1819. After 1820 summer excursions to France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and especially Venice were almost annual occurrences. Gradually, and primarily after the 1819 Italian sojourn, Turner\\'s palette lightened. Traditional notions of chiaroscuro, of alternating bands of light and dark earth colors, yielded to compositions orchestrated in brighter hues, in which the various colors move across the painted surface almost at will, little respecting the forms they describe but in perfect balance.\\r\\nDuring the 1820s and early 1830s Turner committed vast amounts of his creative capital to the production of literary and travel illustrations. These kept an entire generation of engravers employed for several decades. Despite the tendency of his era to stigmatize reproductive engraving as an inferior instrument of artistic presentation, Turner was preoccupied with its processes and potential, acutely aware that, long after his pigments had faded, his reputation would be secure in the more durable brilliance of the engraver\\'s deftly crafted reproductions. A second trip to Italy in 1828 may partially account for the heightened coloring of Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus (1828, National Gallery, London), which John Ruskin described as a pivotal picture in Turner\\'s career.

      "[{'id': 1568, 'description': 'Eugène Boudin (French, 1824–1898)', 'extent': None, 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'artist', 'biography': 'Eugène Boudin is traditionally presented in literature as a self-taught artist, independent of the Parisian art world whose works, painted out of doors in a sketchy, light-hued style, foreshadowed impressionism.1 Recent scholarship has tempered this interpretation of the artist, but it conserves his importance to contemporaneous artistic concerns of modernity, the notion of \"finish,\" the relationship between the French city and countryside, and the marketing of art works.2 Raised by parents who worked on steamers, Boudin grew up in Le Havre on the Normandy coast. At the age of twenty, he and an associate established their own framing and stationery shop where they regularly served artists. In 1847 Boudin went to Paris to study art and made contacts with artists such as Couture (q.v.), who helped him win a three-year study grant in 1850 from the municipal council of Le Havre, and Constant Troyon (1810-1865). But it was along the Normandy coast, not in Paris, where Boudin first met painters Ribot (q.v.) in 1851, Monet (q.v.) in 1858, and Courbet (q.v.) in 1859 and art critic Charles Baudelaire in 1859 and painted in a coarse realist style. Boudin spent each winter, roughly November to May, in Paris, working in his studio. He spent the summer season, lasting from two to five months, making pictures on the Normandy coast or in the Breton landscape. In 1860 he began to paint scenes of fashionable society at the beach resorts of Trouville (The Beach at Trouville, Minneapolis Institute of Arts) and Deauville. At first his work attracted little critical notice, but Baudelaire praised his pastels in a review of the 1859 Salon where Boudin made his debut.4 By 1869 Boudin and his art came to be identified with the Normandy coast.5 After 1870 Boudin increasingly turned away from beach resort subjects to focus on port and harbor views and fisherfolk scenes. In 1881 Boudin entered into a business relationship with the important Parisian art dealer Durand-Ruel, who provided him with a regular income for the rights to his entire production. When Durand-Ruel mounted a one-person exhibition of Boudin\\'s works in 1883, the artist enjoyed financial and critical triumph. Boudin sold his first picture to the French state in 1886 (A Squall, Musée de Morlaix) and his second two years later (The Russian Corvette in the Eure Reservoir, Musée d\\'Agen). In 1892 he was decorated with the Legion of Honor. Extremely productive until the end of his life, Boudin left more than four thousand paintings and seven thousand works on paper, some of which he or his family bequeathed to the French nation and art museums of Le Havre and Honfleur. The reputation that Boudin quietly established is nowhere better evidenced than in the fact that the retro-spective exhibition of his work (January 1898) was held at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where Boudin never set foot and which had fought, and failed, to privilege history painting over landscape and genre. <br>1. By 1883 art critic Gustave Geffroy had already pronounced that Boudin \"is, together with Corot and Jongkind, one of the immediate precursors of Impressionism. He shows us that impenetrable black does not exist and that air is transparent.\" Cited in trans. in Hamilton 1992, 42. <br>2. See John House, \"Boudin\\'s Modernity,\" in Hamilton 1992, 15-23. <br>3. Courbet first visited Le Havre in 1841, the year he moved to Paris from Ornans. He returned at the time of the 1858 Salon du Havre, to which he contributed, and again in 1859. He is reported to have bought some of Boudin\\'s paintings. In 1865 the two painters socialized together and painted side by side at Trouville. <br>4. The artist exhibited no pastels in the Salon, but Baudelaire might have seen them in the artist\\'s studio or elsewhere. 5.

Cowan Pottery produced both artistic and commercial work in a variety of styles influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, Art Deco, Chinese ceramics, and modern sculpture. <br> <br>During its two decades of operation, a number of well-known Cleveland School artists worked with Cowan at the studio: Elizabeth Anderson, Arthur Eugene Baggs, Alexander Blazys, Paul Bogatay, Edris Eckhardt, Waylande Gregory, A. Drexler Jacobson, Raoul Josset, Paul Manship, José Martin, Herman Matzen, F. Luis Mora, Elmer L. Novotny, Margaret Postgate, Stephen Rebeck, Guy L. Rixford, Viktor Schreckengost, Elsa Vick Shaw, Walter Sinz, Frank N. Wilcox, H. Edward Winter, and Thelma Frazier Winter. With the exception of Guy Cowan, himself, Waylande Gregory designed more pieces for the pottery than anyone else. Among Cowan\\'s finest pieces were three limited edition figures relating to dance, including \"Salome\" (1928), \"The Nautch Dancer,\" (1930), and \"The Burlesque Dancer,\" (1930).

Millet received a stipend from the city to move to Paris in 1837, enrolling in the École des Beaux-Arts in the studio of Delaroche (q.v.), where he met Couture (q.v.). Within two years he had left Delaroche, and his stipend was withdrawn. To earn a living, he executed pastels and small paintings in the style of Jean Antoine Watteau (1684-1729) and François Boucher (1703-1770). In 1839 the first painting that Millet sent to the Salon, Saint Anne Instructing the Virgin, was refused.

      "[{'id': 1868, 'description': 'Charles-Émile Jacque (French, 1813–1894)', 'extent': None, 'qualifier': None, 'role': 'artist', 'biography': 'After his schooling, Charles-Émile Jacque began work in a notary\\'s office, but he quickly departed to pursue printmaking. Apprenticed at seventeen to a map engraver, he made his first etching the same year, a female head after Rembrandt. Dissatisfied with cartography, Jacque joined the army, where he served seven years. During this time he prepared the lithographic album Militairiana (1840), praised by poet and critic Charles Baudelaire for the frankness of its caricatures of military life. Jacque worked in London in 1836-38 producing woodcuts to illustrate Shakespeare and a history of Greece. Back in France he established his reputation as an illustrator and contributed caricatures to Charivari in 1843 and 1844. Married in 1843, he made his debut at the Salon as an etcher two years later, his prints prompting Baudelaire\\'s admiration once again. Jacque played a key role in the revival of etching in France during the 1840s, but he also began to paint in this period. He depicted windmills at Montmartre in emulation of Michel (q.v.), whose dramatic landscapes would remain a source of inspiration. Jacque\\'s realist paintings of animals in the country, especially pigs, chickens, and sheep, soon became his hallmark, and in 1848 the state bought his picture Herd of Cattle at the Drinking Hole (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Angers). In the spring of 1849, to avoid cholera in Paris, Jacque and his friend of three years Millet (q.v.) moved their families to adjoining properties in the artists\\' colony of Barbizon. Jacque introduced Millet to rustic themes, while Millet\\'s work prompted Jacque to imbue his peasant subjects with more vigor. Besides making art, Jacque bred poultry, cultivated asparagus, and invested in real estate in Barbizon. He also wrote and illustrated the book Le poulailler: Monographie des poules indigènes et exotiques (The Henhouse: Monograph on Native and Exotic Poultry, 1858). These business interests distinguished him from his Barbizon colleagues and contributed to the cooling of his friendship with Millet and others. In the 1850s and 1860s Jacque experimented with larger print formats, and he exhibited animal paintings at the Salon for the first time in 1861, winning a third-class medal. After 1860 he spent more time in Paris than Barbizon and in the 1870s established a factory for the production of \"artistic furniture\" based on Gothic and Renaissance pieces. Between 1870 and 1888 Jacque did not show at the Salon, but he continued to produce and sell works through dealers. Repeating the same themes, he began to use the palette knife and painted more thickly and freely. Combining art and business, he helped establish and became president of the Société des Animaliers Français in 1881. Outliving the other Barbizon artists, the elderly Jacque called himself \"the last of the romantics.\" He profited from the Anglo-American taste for landscape in the late nineteenth century. At the 1889 Exposition Universelle Jacque obtained a gold medal as painter and a grand prix as printmaker.', 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1813', 'death_year': '1894'}]\n",
